<h2>Principles</h2>

<ol>
  <!-- Mention that objects _are_ individualistic? (as opposed to SmallTalk) -->
  <!-- Mention variables? -->
  <li><b>Every value is an object</b>. Numbers, strings, blocks of code,
  methods, times, and files are all examples of values. <!-- Define 'value'
  instead? --> <q>An object consists of a set of operations on some hidden
    data.</q> (<a href=#refMITCHELL04 class=ref>Mitchell</a>, p. 277). The
  former are <i>methods</i>; the latter <i>attributes</i>. It is a specific
  entity, such as the number 43 or the file <code>/etc/passwd</code>. <!--
  Explain that everything _isn't_ an object -->
  
  <li><b>Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages</b>. A message
  is a request for an object to perform a specific operation. It is
  <i>sent</i> from one object to another.
  
  <li><b>Objects respond to messages by defining methods</b>. <!-- Do we want
  to claim the _object_ defines the method? --> <!-- "defining"? How about
  "invoking"? --> A method is a description of
  how an object can perform a specific operation, i.e. it is the
  <i>method</i> by which the object responds to a message. Typically, an
  object will respond to a message of <i>size</i> by performing the
  instructions in its <i>size</i> method.
  
  <li><b>Every object is an instance of exactly one class</b>. A class is <q>A
    template defining the implementation of a set of objects.</q> (<a
    href=#refMITCHELL04 class=ref>Mitchell</a>, p. 312) Or, as <a class=ref
    href=#refLIU99>Liu</a> suggests, <q>â€¦a factory that can produce
    programming objects. Each factory makes just one kind of object, or
    product.</q>. An <i>instance of</i> simply describes the class from which
  the object was created, the template that it follows.
  
  <li><b>Classes inherit behaviour (methods) from their superclass</b>.
  Inheritance allows a class to be defined in terms of another (its
  <i>superclass</i>. The former inherits the behaviour of the latter, then
  specialises itself by defining additional behaviour. A <code>Mammal</code>
  class may be a superclass of a <code>Dog</code> class because a dog can do
  everything a mammal can, plus fetch newspapers, etc. <!-- snip etc. -->
  <li><b>Classes are objects</b>.
  <!-- Is this a fundamental? -->
