  <!-- What does it mean to dup or clone a class? -->

  <aside class=sidenote>
    The term <i>class</i> is roughly analogous to its biological definition
    where it denotes a taxonomic rank, however this analogy does not extend to
    subclasses. That is, a subclass of a class is termed a <i>subclass</i>;
    not an <i>order</i>.
  </aside>

  <p>A <dfn id=class>class</dfn> is a <i>classification</i> of objects. It
  defines a set of methods, and can mint objects in its image.</p>

  <section>
    <aside class=sidenote>
      Class names containing non-ASCII characters cannot be referred to
      from source files with a different <a
        href=/programs#source-encoding>source encoding</a>. For example,
      a class name containing character the Greek small letter lamda
      (<code class=u title='λ'>U＋03BB</code>) can only be referenced
      from source files using the UTF-8 source encoding. <!-- FIXME:
      What about other Unicode character sets? -->
    </aside>

    <h1 id=names>Names</h1>

    <!-- Mention Ruby's preference for flat hierarchies -->

    <p>A class<sup>†</sup> is named with a <a
      href=/variables#constants>constant</a>, and this name can be retrieved
    as a <code>String</code> by <code>Class#name</code>. This does not apply
    to <a href=#anonymous>anonymous</a> classes, of course, which have a name
    of <code>nil</code>. Conventionally class names use camel-case
    capitalization: the initial letter of each word is capitalized, and spaces
    between the words are removed. For example:
    <code>RubyProgrammingLanguage</code> or <code>NutsAndBolts</code>. This
    distinguishes a class from a constant <i>qua</i> constant, as the latter
    is named in uppercase.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id=inheritance>Inheritance</h1>

    <p>A class <dfn title=inheritance>inherits</dfn> behaviour and certain
    state-class variables and constants-from another class called its <dfn
      title=superclass>superclass</dfn>. The exception is
    <code>BasicObject</code>, which sits at the top of the class hierarchy.
    The default superclass is <code>Object</code>. Classes that inherit from a
    given class are its <dfn title=subclasses>subclasses</dfn>. A subclass is,
    therefore, a specialisation of its superclass.</p>

    <section>
      <h1 id=superclass>Superclass</h1>
        
      <p>The superclass is a <code>Class</code> object. It is typically specified as a
      constant literal, but can be any expression evaluating to the same. Once
      a class has been created, its superclass cannot be changed.
      <code>Class#superclass</code> returns the receiver’s superclass as a
      <code>Class</code> object, or <code>nil</code> if the receiver is
      <code>BasicObject</code>.    
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1 id=ancestors>Ancestors</h1>

      <p>The <dfn>ancestors</dfn> of a class are the classes and modules it
      inherits from: its superclass and mixed-in modules, then their
      ancestors, and so on up until the root of the inheritance hierarchy.
      They are returned, in order, by <code>Module#ancestors</code> as an
      <code>Array</code> of <code>Class</code> objects.
    </section>

    <!-- http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/class/removal.rb
    -->

    <p>Inheritance merely determines the initial behaviour of a class; the
    subclass can diverge by defining, redefining, or removing methods, or
    modifying state. It occurs because the method— and constant—lookup
    algorithms consider the superclass when unable to resolve a given name
    against the current class. It is worth stating explicitly that instance
    variables and class variables are <em>not</em> inherited. <a
      href=/references#refFLAN08 class=ref>Flanagan &amp; Matsumoto</a> (pp.
    239–240) note a corollary: <q>If a subclass uses an instance variable with
      the same name as a variable used by one of its ancestors, it will
      overwrite the value of its ancestor’s variable.</q></p>

    <section>
      <h1 id=class-inherited><code>Class#inherited</code> Hook</h1>  

      <p>If a class defines a singleton method named <code>:inherited</code>, it
      is invoked when the class is inherited with the subclass as its argument.

      <h1 id=class-keyword><code>class</code> Keyword</h1>

      <p>The <code>class <var>name</var> &lt; <var>superclass</var>…end</code>
      expression opens a class named <var>name</var>. If the constant
      <var>name</var> is already defined it must refer to an existing class,
      otherwise a <code>TypeError</code> is raised.  If <var>name</var> was
      previously undefined, it is created to refer to a new <code>Class</code>
      object. The <code>&lt; <var>superclass</var></code> portion may be
      omitted, in which case the <var>superclass</var> defaults to
      <code>Object</code>. <var>superclass</var> may be any expression that
      evaluates to a <code>Class</code> object. The class body, which may be
      empty, is the elliptical region in the expression. It introduces a new
      context in which <code>self</code> refers to the class.</p>

        <h1 id=reopening>Reopening Classes</h1>

        <p>If <code>class</code> is used with the name of a pre-existing class
        that class is <i>re-opened</i>. If a method is defined in a re-opened
        class with the same name as a pre-existing method in the same class
        the old method is overwritten with the new. Classes can be made
        immutable, effectively preventing them from being reopened by freezing
        the class object. Frozen classes raise <code>RuntimeError</code>s when
        methods are defined, or variables manipulated, in their context.</p>

        <h1 id=anonymous>Anonymous Classes</h1>

        <p>When a class is named with a constant it is accessible wherever
        that constant is in scope. If this behaviour is not desirable, a class
        can be made anonymous by assigning the value of <code>Class.new</code>
        to a local variable, thus restricting the class to the local scope.
        Subsequently assigning this variable to a constant, names the
        class.</p>

      <h1 id=structs>Structs</h1>
  
      <p><code>Struct</code> is a class generator, particularly useful for
      classes that only need to wrap data. It it instantiated with a list
      of attribute names as <code>Symbol</code>s, and returns a
      <code>Class</code> object with accessors and writers for each
      attribute. The generated class can be instantiated with a list of
      arguments, which are assigned to the corresponding attributes.</p>

      <figure class=left id=struct-new.rb>
        <figcaption>Creating a class with <code>Struct.new</code>
      </figure>

      <p>A popular idiom is to create a class that inherits from a
      <code>Struct</code>: the <code>Struct</code> defines the simple
      attributes, and the class body adds behaviour/customisations.</p>

      <figure class=left id=struct-inheritance.rb>

    <section>
      <h1 id=nesting>Nesting</h1>
 
      <p>A class may be defined within the body of another class. The fully
      qualified name of the inner class is then
      <code><var>outer</var>::<var>inner</var></code>: the name of the
      enclosing class (<var>outer</var>) separated from that of the enclosed
      (<var>inner</var>) with the <a
        href=/variables#constants-references>scope operator</a>. This
      <dfn>nesting</dfn> behaviour is primarily used for namespacing, with <a
        href=/modules>modules</a> being an alternative. However, it does not
      affect inheritance: if the inner class is to inherit from the outer
      class, it must do so explicitly. The nesting of a class is returned as
      an <code>Array</code> of <code>Class</code> objects by
      <code>Module#nesting</code>, where the first element is the innermost
      class, and the last the outermost.
    </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id=context>Context</h1>

    <p><code>Class#class_eval</code> takes a string or block which it
    evaluates in the receiver’s context, setting <code>self</code> to the
    receiver. The evaluated code can access the class’s state, invoke its
    singleton methods, and define methods. <code>Class#instance_exec</code> is
    similar, but accepts any number of arguments which it passes to the
    required block.

  <section>
    <h1 id=singleton>Singleton Classes</h1>
  
    <aside class=sidenote>
      <span class=sidemark>†</span><a href=/references#refFLAN08>Flanagan
        &amp; Matsumoto</a> (2008, pp. 257–258) use the term
      <i>eigenclass</i>, instead, but the preferred nomenclature is now
      <i>singleton class</i>. See <a
        href=//redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/1082>Feature #1082: add
        Object#singleton_class method</a> for the background.
    </aside>

    <p>Every object is associated with two classes: that with which it was
    instantiated, and an anonymous class specific to the object: its
    <dfn>singleton class</dfn><sup>†</sup>. 

    <p>That a singleton class is unique to a particular object means that
    methods defined within it-<a href=/methods#singleton>singleton</a>
    methods-are also unique to that object. Further, an object’s class-i.e.
    the one which instantiated it-is the superclass of its singleton class.
    Upon receiving a message an object asks his singleton class for a method,
    the singleton class searches its instance methods and included modules,
    then repeats the query to his superclass. This process continues,
    recursively, up the inheritance hierarchy until a suitable method is
    located. Therefore, singleton methods override all others because the
    singleton class is the first place searched.
    
    <p>The singleton class is a curious hybrid between class and module
    because although it has a superclass, it cannot be instantiated. However,
    the latter shortcoming is surely a blessing, as without it class
    hierarchies would be plexiform. Regardless, the abstractionists will
    delight in the fact that a singleton class has its own singleton class,
    <i>ad infinitum</i>&hellip;

    <p>Instances of the <code>Integer</code>, <code>Float</code>, and
    <code>Symbol</code> classes are the only objects not to have a
    singleton class; attempting to open one causes a <code>TypeError</code>
    to be raised.</p>

    <aside class=sidenote>
      <span class=sidemark>‡</span>Prior to Ruby 1.9.2 the peculiar
      <code>class &lt;&lt; <var>object</var>…end</code> construct— the
      <code>class</code> keyword followed by two less-than signs, an
      expression evaluating to an object, then the class body—was used to
      open the singleton class of <var>object</var>.
    </aside>

    <p>The <code>Kernel#singleton_class</code><sup>‡</sup> method returns
    the receiver’s singleton class as a <code>Class</code> object. It is
    typically paired with <code>#class_eval</code> so as to operate within
    the context of the class.

  <section>
    <h1 id=state>State</h1>  

    <p>A class may store its state in <a href=/variables#class>class
      variables</a>, as discussed previously, however, due to the unpopular
    semantics of class variables, class instance variables may be used
    instead.</p>

    <!-- The canonical example of class variables is an object maintaing
    an initialization count. Show how to do this with class instance

    instance methods more palpable
    -->
    <section>
      <h1 id=class-instance-variables>Class Instance Variables</h1>

      <p>An instance variable used within a class definition, outside of an
      instance method, is a <dfn title="class instance variable">class
        instance variable</dfn>. It is not to be confused with a class
      variable. Both kinds of variables are associated with the class, as
      opposed to its instances. The primary advantage of class instance
      variables over class variables is that they don't exhibit the latter’s
      awkward sharing semantics: class instance variables are not shared with
      subclasses. However, class instance variables cannot be referenced in
      instance methods—as in that context they are normal instance
      variables—so are not necessarily appropriate substitutes.

      <p>Accessor methods can be created for class instance variables by using
      <code>Module#attr_accessor</code> and <code>Module#attr_writer</code>
      inside the class’s singleton class.</p>

  <section>
    <h1 id=methods>Methods</h1>

    <p>The methods defined on a class can be listed with
    <code>Object#methods</code> or <code>Object#instance_methods</code>. They

    method is given an argument of <code>false</code>, superclass methods are
    omitted.</p>

    <section>
      <h1 id=method-defined><code>method_defined?</code> Predicate</h1>
      
      <p>The <code>Module#method_defined?</code> predicate accepts a method
      name as argument and returns <code>true</code> if the named instance
      method is defined on the receiver; <code>false</code> otherwise.
      <code>Module#public_method_defined?</code>,
      <code>Module#private_method_defined?</code>, and
      <code>Module#protected_method_defined?</code> behave in a similar
      fashion, but also require the named method to have the corresponding <a
        href=/methods#visibility>visibility</a> These predicates are clearly
      similar to <a href=/messages#responding><code>#respond_to?</code></a>
      but they differ as follows:

      <ul>
        <li>They test the instance methods of a class or module;
        <code>#respond_to?</code> tests the methods defined on its receiver.             
        <li>They can only be used on classes or modules;
        <code>#respond_to?</code> with any object inheriting from
        <code>Object</code>.
        <li>They don’t consult <a
          href=/methods#respond-to-missing><code>#respond_to_missing?</code></a>—whereas
        <code>#respond_to?</code> does—which means that they don’t reflect
        methods defined with <a
          href=/methods#method-missing><code>method_missing</code></a>.
        <li>They return <code>true</code> for methods unimplemented on the
        user’s platform; <code>#respond_to?</code> behaves conversely.
      </ul>

    <h1 id=type>Type</h1> 

    <p><q>In many object-oriented languages, class names are used…for the
      type of objects generated from the class.</q> <a class=ref
      href=/references#refBRUCE02>Bruce</a> (p 20). <a
      href=/references#refKLAS95 class=ref>Klas &amp; Schrefl</a> concur:
    <q>A class…defines…the type of [its] instances</q> (p 10). Applying
    this notion to Ruby is problematic because while it is certainly
    possible for a method to dynamically <i>type check</i> its arguments
    with the <code>Kernel#is_a?(<var>class</var>)</code> predicate, this
    approach is both insufficient and unnecessary. 

    <p>It is insufficient because an object’s class is not indicative of its
    suitability for a specific role. Class-based type checking rests on
    the premise that all objects of a given type will respond to the same
    messages in the same fashion. However, Ruby’s classes may be modified at
    will—allowing their methods to be redefined or removed—so two objects of
    the same class will not necessarily provide the same behaviour. Similarly,
    methods may be defined on, or removed from, individual objects, again
    breaking the assumption.

    <p>It is unnecessary because Ruby offers a superior, meritocratic
    alternative called “duck typing” (<a href=/references#refTHOM09
      class=ref>Thomas et al.</a>, p 372): if an object responds to the
    messages it would be sent in the course of a computation it
    constitutes suitable input. The yardstick is ability; not class.
     
    <p>An optimistic method simply assumes that its arguments are suitable;
    allowing them to raise a <code>NoMethodError</code> if sent a message they
    don't understand. This allows for particularly flexible <abbr
      title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s at the cost of
    potentially obscure error messages for nonsensical arguments. More
    typically, the <code>Kernel#respond_to?(<var>selector</var>)</code>
    predicate is used to determine the suitability of an object. For instance,
    a method may raise an <code>ArgumentError</code> unless its argument
    responds to <code>:&lt;&lt;</code>. A refinement may to send an argument
    the appropriate <code>:try_convert</code> message, raising an exception if
    <code>nil</code> is returned.
