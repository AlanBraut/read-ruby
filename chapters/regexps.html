  <p>A <code>Regexp</code> represents a pattern that describes a
  <code>String</code>. It <i>matches</i> when contained by the former. The
  literal is of the form
  <code>/<var>pattern</var>/<var>options</var></code>: a pattern delimited
  by solidi, followed by zero or more option specifiers.</p>

  <p>The pattern consists of literal characters and meta-characters. A
  literal character is a non-meta-character; it matches itself. Prefixing a
  meta-character with a reverse solidus causes it to match literally.
  <!-- List the meta-characters explicitly? -->
  
  <p>A balanced pair of parentheses are meta-characters which group and/or
  capture the characters they enclose. Grouping allows the enclosed to be
  treated as an atomic whole such that meta-characters directly following
  the closing parenthesis act on the whole. Capturing is the extraction of
  specific parts of the text being matched so it can be referred to later,
  from within the pattern <!-- Mention backreferences? --> or the
  surrounding program. Parentheses do not capture if the opening parenthesis
  is directly followed by <code>?:</code>. Captures can be referred to by
  name if the opening parenthesis is followed by
  <code>?&lt;<var>name</var>&gt;</code>.  Alternatively, they can be
  referred to by number, where the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> group of
  parentheses is numbered <var>n</var>.
  
  <p>A literal character or parenthetical may be followed by a quantifier
  meta-character which specifies how many consecutive occurrences are
  required at that point in the pattern. <code>+</code> requires at least
  one, <code>*</code> zero or more, and
  <code>{<var>min</var>,<var>max</var>}</code> between <var>min</var> and
  <var>max</var> times. <!-- Note that one of these can be omitted? -->
  
  <p>A character class specifies a set of characters, one of which must
  appear at that point in the pattern, enclosed within a pair of square
  brackets. The characters are specified literally, one after the other. A
  range of consecutive characters may be abbreviated with the notation
  <code><var>start</var>-<var>end</var></code>: the first character in the
  range separated from the last by a hyphen. Inside a character class the
  hyphen is therefore a metacharacter, so to be matched literally must
  appear immediately before the right square bracket.
  
  <p>There are pre-defined character classes to match alphabetical
  characters (<code>[[:alpha:]]</code>), lowercase
  (<code>[[:lower:]]</code>), uppercase (<code>[[:upper:]]</code>),
  alphanumerics (<code>[[:alnum:]]</code>), digits
  (<code>[[:digit:]]</code>), whitespace (<code>[[:space:]]</code>), and
  punctuation (<code>[[:punct:]]</code>), among others. The period matches
  any character except newline.
  
  <p>A vertical line is a meta-character specifying that either the
  expression to its right, or that to its left, must match. It is usually used
  inside a parenthetical.
  
  <p><code>String#match</code> returns a <code>MatchData</code> object if
  the match succeeded; <code>nil</code> otherwise. <code>MatchData#[]</code>
  returns the text captured by the capture group given as a
  <code>Symbol</code>, for a named group, or an <code>Integer</code>.</p>

    <h1 id=encoding>Encoding</h1>

    <p>A <code>Regexp</code> is associated with an encoding which must be
    compatible with that of the <code>String</code> it is matched against.
    By default a <code>Regexp</code> has the same encoding as the source
    file in which it is contained, with the following exceptions:

    <ul>
      <li>An ASCII-only Regexp has the encoding US-ASCII when the source
      encoding is ASCII-compatible.
      <li>An encoding option has been specified, in which case the
      corresponding encoding is used, as follows:
        <dl class=inline>
          <dt><code>u</code><dd>UTF-8
          <dt><code>e</code><dd>EUC-JP
          <dt><code>s</code><dd>Windows-31J
          <dt><code>n</code><dd>ASCII-8BIT
        </dl>
      <li>The use of Unicode character escapes within a pattern force the
      <code>Regexp</code> to have UTF-8 encoding.
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to the single-letter encoding options described above, a
    <code>Regexp</code> can be encoded in any supporting encoding. This
    requires the <code>Regexp</code> to be constructed with
    <code>Regexp.new</code>, passing it the pattern as a <code>String</code>
    associated with the desired encoding. The same technique, <i>mutatis
      mutandis</i>, can be used with <code>String#force_encoding</code> to
    associate the <code>Regexp</code> with a different encoding.</p>

    <figure id=regexp-specify-encoding.rb>
      <figcaption>Initially, this <code>Regexp</code> adopts the source
      encoding. Passing <code>Regexp.new</code> the pattern encoded as
      ISO-8859-1 creates a regexp with the same pattern and the given
      encoding.

      <h1 id=fixed-encoding>Fixed Encoding</h1>

      <p>The encoding of a <code>Regexp</code> is said to be <dfn
        title='fixed encoding'>fixed</dfn> if its encoding and/or pattern is
      incompatible with ASCII. This is significant because a
      <code>Regexp</code> with a non-fixed encoding can match any
      <code>String</code> whose encoding is ASCII-compatible. The
      <code>Regexp#fixed_encoding?</code> predicate returns
      <code>true</code> if its receiverâ€™s encoding is fixed;
      <code>false</code> otherwise.
