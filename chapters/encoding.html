  <h1 id=encoding>Encoding</h1>

  <p>An encoding is a mapping between byte sequences and characters<a
    href=#fn-encoding-dfn>†</a>. Each program source file,
  <code>String</code>, <code>Symbol</code>, <code>Regexp</code>,
  <code>File</code>, and <code>IO</code> object is, relatively independently,
  associated with its own encoding. This <a
    href=/text#string-associate>association</a> is simply a statement, that
  has either been made explicitly about a specific object, or derived from a
  corresponding default encoding. It may even be spurious. 

  <p>The encoding associated with a source file-the <a href=#source><i>source
      encoding</i></a>-is by default US-ASCII. If a source file contains
  characters outside of this encoding, it must specify which one, otherwise
  Ruby refuses to load it. 
  
  <p>The encoding associated with <a
    href=/text#string-encoding><code>String</code></a>s, <a
    href=/text#symbol-encoding><code>Symbol</code></a>s, and <a
    href=/text#regexp-encoding><code>Regexp</code></a>s, is by default the
  source encoding of the file in which they are contained. However, if their
  literals contain certain character escapes, this is changed implicitly. As
  with source files, this association can be overridden on a per-object basis. 
  
  <p>An <code>IO</code> or <code>File</code> object represents an external
  data stream, whose encoding is termed its <a href=#external><i>external
      encoding</i></a>. Data read from a stream is associated with this
  encoding. Unless set explicitly, it defaults to an encoding inferred from
  the user’s environment. Both types of object <em>may</em> also be associated
  with an <a href=#internal><i>internal encoding</i></a>: that which the
  programmer desires it to have. If set explicitly, data read from the stream
  is transcoded to the internal encoding; while data written to it is
  transcoded to the external encoding. The internal encoding is never inferred
  or derived, so by default no transcoding occurs.

  <p><a href=#transcoding><i>Transcoding</i></a> is quite distinct from mere
  <i>association</i>. Whereas the latter changed an attribute of an object,
  the former converts its contents: translating its underlying bytes to their
  equivalent representation in another encoding. This chapter discusses both
  topics, but it is essential to be cognizant of their difference.</p>

  <section>
    <h1 id=class>The <code>Encoding</code> Class</h1>

    <p>Ruby represents the encodings that she understands as instances of
    the <code>Encoding</code> class, defining each as a constant under the
    <code>Encoding</code> namespace. The constant is named after the
    upper-case encoding name, with low lines replacing hyphen-minus
    characters. For example, <code>Encoding::UTF_8</code> or
    <code>Encoding::Windows_1250</code>. Given an encoding name as a
    <code>String</code>, the corresponding <code>Encoding</code> object may
    be retrieved with <code>Encoding.find(<var>name</var>)</code>.
    
    <p>A list of built-in encodings may be retrieved as an <code>Array</code>
    of <code>Encoding</code> objects with the <code>Encoding.list</code>
    method. <code>Encoding.aliases</code> returns a <code>Hash</code> whose
    keys are encoding aliases, and values are the corresponding built-in
    encoding. Methods that expect encodings as arguments accept instances of
    <code>Encoding</code>, or <code>String</code>s naming a built-in encoding
    or its alias. The <code>Encoding</code> object  associated with a
    <code>String</code>, <code>Symbol</code>, or <code>Regexp</code> is
    returned by their <code>#encoding</code> method.

    <h1 id=source>Source Encoding</h1>

    <p>The <dfn>source encoding</dfn> is the character encoding of a given
    source file. It is US-ASCII by default. A <code>SyntaxError</code> is
    raised when a source file contains one or more characters invalid in the
    source encoding.

    <p>A file’s source encoding may be specified inline by means of a
    <dfn>coding comment</dfn>: a specially formatted comment that declares the
    encoding of the lines that follow. If omitted, the default source encoding
    is assumed. If a source file contains a <a
      href=/programs#shebang>shebang</a> line, the coding comment must appear
    on the second line; otherwise it must appear on the first.</p>

    <p>The coding comment is a US-ASCII string which begins with a number
    sign (<code class=u title='#'>U＋0023</code>) and contains<a
      href=#fn-coding-contain>†</a> the string <code>coding</code>
    followed by an equals sign (<code class=u title='='>U＋003D</code>) or
    colon (<code class=u title=':'>U＋003A</code>) then the name of the
    source encoding. The encoding name is one of those returned by
    <code>Encoding.name_list</code> written in a case insensitive fashion.

    <p>The source encoding of the currently executing code can be obtained
    with the <a href=/programs#encoding><code>__ENCODING__</code></a>
    keyword.</p>

    <h1 id=external>External Encoding</h1>

    <p>The encoding of the data in an <code>IO</code> stream is known by Ruby
    as the object’s <dfn>external encoding</dfn>. Every <code>IO</code> object
    has an external encoding, so data read from it will be associated with the
    same. Ruby infers the default external encoding with the following steps<a
      href=#fn-external-encoding-algo>*</a>, stopping as soon as she finds one
    which is usable:

    <dl>
      <dt><code>Encoding.default_external=</code>
      <dd>If an <code>Encoding</code> object, or name, been assigned to
      <code>Encoding.default_external=</code>, that is the default external
      encoding.
      <dt>Interpreter’s <code>-E</code> switch
      <dd>If the Ruby interpreter was invoked with an
      <code>-E<var>encoding</var></code> option, <var>encoding</var> is the
      default external encoding.
      <dt>Locale encoding
      <dd>Use the encoding derived from the user’s environment, as explained
      below.
    </dl>  
  
    <section>
      <h1 id=locale>Locale Encoding</h1>
      
      <p>The <dfn>locale encoding</dfn> is an encoding inferred from the
      user’s environment that Ruby supports. It is determined in two distinct
      stages, the first of which is to interrogate the user’s environment for
      his preferred encoding:
      
      <ol>
        <li>Inspect relevant environment variables, e.g.
        <code>LANG</code>, <code>LC_CTYPE</code>, or <code>LC_ALL</code>
        <li>Or, if the platform is Windows or Cygwin, by invoking C’s
        <code>nl_langinfo_codeset()</code> or Windows’ <a
          href=//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683162(VS.85).aspx><code>GetConsoleCP()</code></a>
        function.
      </ol>

      <p>The result of this search, or <code>nil</code> if it failed, is the
      <dfn>locale charmap</dfn> encoding, and is assigned to
      <code>Encoding.locale_charmap</code>. Ruby must now correlate this
      encoding with the encodings she supports to determine the <dfn>locale
        encoding</dfn>:

      <ol>
        <li>If the locale charmap encoding is known to Ruby-that
        is, <code>Encoding.find(Encoding.locale_charmap)</code> returns an
        <code>Encoding</code> object-that becomes the locale encoding.
        <li>If the locale charmap encoding couldn’t be determined, the locale
        encoding is US-ASCII.
        <li>Otherwise, the locale encoding is ASCII-8BIT.
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!--
    $ LANG=braile ruby -e 'p [Encoding.locale_charmap, Encoding.find("locale")]'
    ["ANSI_X3.4-1968", #<Encoding:US-ASCII>]
    -->

    <p>By default, as the name suggests, all <code>IO</code> objects have the
    default external encoding as their external encoding. However, this may
    also be set on a per-stream basis by specifying an external encoding when
    <a href=/io#open>opening</a> an I/O stream, or with
    <code>IO#set_encoding(<var>encoding</var>)</code>, where
    <var>encoding</var> is an encoding name or <code>Encoding</code> object.
    The external encoding of a stream may be queried with
    <code>IO#external_encoding</code>, which returns the corresponding
    <code>Encoding</code> object. Note, however, that if the stream is in
    write-only mode, and wasn’t explicitly assigned an external encoding, this
    method returns <code>nil</code>.  
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id=internal>Internal Encoding</h1>

    <p>Optionally, an <code>IO</code> object may also be associated with an
    <dfn>internal encoding</dfn>. This is the encoding that the programmer
    wishes to use with the data in a stream. The default value of an
    <code>IO</code> object’s internal encoding is equal to the <dfn>default
      internal encoding</dfn> (<code>Encoding.default_internal</code>), which
    is determined as follows:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>Encoding.default_internal=</code>
      <dd>If an <code>Encoding</code> object, or name, been assigned to
      <code>Encoding.default_internal=</code>, that is the default internal
      encoding.
      <dt>Interpreter’s <code>-E</code> switch
      <dd>If the Ruby interpreter was invoked with an
      <code>-E<var>external</var>:<var>internal</var></code> or
      <code>-E:<var>internal</var></code> option, where both
      <var>external</var> and <var>internal</var> are valid encoding names,
      the default internal encoding is <var>internal</var>.
      <dt>Interpreter’s <code>-U</code> switch
      <dd>If the interpreter was invoked with the <code>-U</code> switch, the
      default internal encoding is UTF-8
    </dl>  

    <p>If all the above steps failed, the default internal encoding is
    <code>nil</code>. Therefore, unlike the default external encoding which is
    inferred automatically from one’s locale, the default internal encoding is
    <code>nil</code> unless set explicitly.

    <p>The internal encoding of an <code>IO</code> may be changed from this
    default on a per-stream basis by specifying an internal encoding when <a
      href=#open>opening</a> the stream, or with
    <code>IO#set_encoding(<var>external</var>, <var>internal</var>)</code>,
    where both <var>external</var> and <var>internal</var> are encoding names
    or <code>Encoding</code> objects. Alternatively,
    <code>IO#set_encoding</code> may be given a <code>String</code> of the
    form <code><var>external</var>:<var>internal</var></code>. 

    <p>An internal encoding of <code>nil</code> means that the programmer does
    not express a preference for how the data he reads and writes via I/O is
    encoded. Accordingly, Ruby associates the data with the stream’s external
    encoding, and gets out of the way. This, too, is the situation if the
    stream’s external encoding is equal to its internal encoding: the data is
    already encoded how the programmer requires. 
    
    <p>The internal encoding is relevant when it is both set-that is, has a
    non-<code>nil</code> value-and differs from the <a href=#external>external
      encoding</a>. To honour the internal encoding, Ruby <a
      href=#transcoding>transcodes</a> data read from a stream from the
    external to the internal encoding, and transcodes
    data written to the stream from the internal to the external encoding.

    <p>The transcoding works exactly the same as <a
      href=#transcoding><code>String#encode</code></a>, so the <a
      href=#encode-options-hash><code>#encode</code> options
      <code>Hash</code></a> may be merged with the <a
      href=#options-hash><code>IO</code></a> wherever the latter is accepted.
    For example, it may be supplied as the final argument of <a
      href=/io#init><code>IO.new</code></a> or <code>IO#set_encoding</code>. 
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id=ascii-8bit>ASCII-8BIT</h1>

    <p>Ruby defines an encoding named <code>ASCII-8BIT</code>, with an alias
    of <code>BINARY</code>, which does not correspond to any known encoding.
    It is intended to be associated with binary data, such as the bytes that
    make up a <abbr title='Portable Network Graphics'>PNG</abbr> image, so has
    no restrictions on content. One byte always corresponds with one
    character. This allows a <code>String</code>, for instance, to be treated
    as <a href=/text#byte-array>bag of bytes</a> rather than a sequence of
    characters. <code>ASCII-8BIT</code>, then, effectively corresponds to the
    absence of an encoding, so methods that expect an encoding name recognise
    <code>nil</code> as a synonym.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id=compatibility>Compatibility</h1>

    <p>Methods of <code>String</code> and <code>Regexp</code> that take
    another such object as an argument require the encodings associated with
    the objects to be <dfn>compatible</dfn>. An encoding is always
    compatible with itself, so operations involving two objects associated
    with the same encoding are allowed. Likewise, two objects are compatible
    if they are both <a href=/text#ascii-only>ASCII-only</a>.

    <p>The compatibility of other combinations of encodings can be
    determined with <code>Encoding.compatible?</code>, which compares the
    encoding of its two arguments, which are either <code>Encoding</code>
    objects or objects associated with encodings. If they are compatible,
    the encoding which would result from their combination is returned;
    otherwise, <code>nil</code> results. Operating on objects with
    incompatible encodings causes an
    <code>Encoding::CompatibilityError</code> exception to be raised.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id=transcoding>Transcoding</h1>

    <p><dfn>Transcoding</dfn> a <code>String</code> converts its bytes to the
    equivalent byte sequences in a given encoding, with which it associates
    the result. It is typically performed with <code>String#encode</code>, which
    returns its receiver transcoded from a <var>source</var> encoding to a
    <var>target</var> encoding. <code>String#encode!</code> operates in the
    same manner, but transcodes the receiver in-place.

    <p>By default, <var>source</var> is the receiver’s current encoding, and
    <var>target</var> is the <a href=#internal>default internal</a> encoding.
    When called with one encoding argument, this becomes the <var>target</var>
    encoding. When called with two encoding arguments, the first is the
    <var>target</var>, the second is the <var>source</var>. This last form is
    mainly useful when the <code>String</code> is associated with <a
      href=#ascii-8bit><code>ASCII-8BIT</code></a>: it associates the
    <code>String</code> with <var>source</var>, then transcodes from
    <var>source</var> to <var>target</var>.

    <p>If a character in the <code>String</code> does not exist in the
    <var>target</var> encoding, or the <code>String</code> contains bytes
    invalid in its current encoding, an exception is raised.  This behaviour
    can be changed by supplying an <var>options</var> <code>Hash</code> as the
    final argument, whose form is described in the table that follows.</p>

    <table id=options-hash class=border>

      <h1 id=converter><code>Encoding::Converter</code></h1>
      
      <p>The <code>Encoding::Converter</code> class provides additional
      control over the transcoding process.
      <code>Encoding::Converter.new</code> takes a source encoding as its
      first argument, and a destination encoding as its second. Both may be
      given as encoding names or <code>Encoding</code> objects. An <a
        href=#options-hash>options <code>Hash</code></a> may be supplied as a
      third argument.</p>

      <section>
        <h1 id=conversion-path>Conversion Path</h1>

        <p>Text is transcoded along a <dfn>conversion path</dfn>. Each step
        involves a source encoding and a destination encoding. In the simple
        case, the conversion path will have only one step: from the given
        source encoding to the given destination encoding. However, more
        complex transcoding requires intermediate stages, e.g. to transcode
        Big5 into ISO-8859-9, we must first transcode to UTF-8: Big5 to UTF-8,
        then UTF-8 to ISO-8859-9. The source and destination encodings that
        are currently in use are returned by
        <code>Encoding::Converter#source_encoding</code> and
        <code>Encoding::Converter#destination_encoding</code>, respectively,
        as <code>Encoding</code> objects.</p>

        <p>The various newline conversion options and those which perform
        escaping are termed <dfn title='transcoding
          decorators'>decorators</dfn>, and also feature in the conversion
        path. If the destination encoding is ASCII-compatible, they appear as
        the final steps, i.e. after any encoding pairs. Otherwise, they appear
        before the final step.

        <p><code>Encoding::Converter#convpath</code> returns an
        <code>Array</code> of steps in the conversion path. Steps which convert
        between two encodings are represented as an <code>Array</code> of the
        respective <code>Encoding</code> objects. A steps which applies a
        decorator appears as a <code>String</code> naming the decorator.

        <p><code>Encoding::Converter.new</code> may be invoked with an
        <code>Array</code> in this form as an argument. The instantiated
        converter then uses this conversion path rather than inferring one
        from its arguments.
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1 id=convert>Piecemeal Conversion</h1>

        <p>An <code>Encoding::Converter</code> object can perform piecemeal
        transcoding, by repeatedly calling
        <code>Encoding::Converter#convert</code> with the next fragment of
        input. The fragment is transcoded and returned, associated with the
        destination encoding. However, because each fragment is always assumed
        to be part of a larger source, it may legitimately end mid-character,
        i.e.  prior to a character boundary.  These trailing bytes are
        buffered internally, and the successfully transcoded characters are
        returned. Then, when <code>#convert</code> is called next, its
        argument is assumed to supply the remaining bytes. If an unambiguously
        invalid byte sequence is encountered, an exception is raised.

        <p>Conceptually, we can explain this process as follows. When an
        <code>Encoding::Converter</code> instance is created, an empty
        <var>pending</var> buffer is created. Each time it is called,
        <code>#convert</code> initialises two empty buffers of its own:
        <var>source</var> and <var>destination</var>. It copies its argument
        into <var>source</var>, which it then processes byte-by-byte:

        <ol>
          <li>The byte is appended to <var>pending</var> and removed
          from <var>source</var>. The next action depends on the contents of
          <var>pending</var>:
            <ol>
              <li>If it constitutes a valid character in the destination
              encoding, it is transcoded and written to
              <var>destination</var>. <var>pending</var> is emptied.
              <li>If it constitutes a byte sequence that could be valid in the
              source encoding, but currently isn’t, it is left in
              <var>pending</var> in the hope that the next call to
              <code>#convert</code> will supply the remaining bytes.
              <li>If it is invalid in the source encoding, regardless of
              subsequent input, an
              <code>Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError</code> exception is
              raised.
              <li>If its valid in the source encoding, but a corresponding
              character does not exist in the destination encoding, an
              <code>Encoding::UndefinedConversionError</code> exception is
              raised.
          </ol>
          <li>When the source buffer is empty, the destination buffer is
          returned, then emptied.
        </ol>

        <p>Thus, after <code>#convert</code> returns <var>destination</var>,
        <var>pending</var> may not be empty. An implication is that a call to
        <code>#convert</code> may raise an exception because, when combined
        with the contents of <var>pending</var>, its argument was invalid.
        i.e. an exception may be raised even if the argument is in itself
        valid.  Therefore, when there is no more text to transcode,
        <code>Encoding::Converter#finish</code> should be called to signal
        that the contents of <var>pending</var> should be transcoded and
        returned. If <var>pending</var> isn’t empty when <code>#finish</code>
        is called, this normally results in one of the aforementioned
        exceptions being raised, because if its contents constitute a valid
        character, it would have already been returned by
        <code>#convert</code>. However, if the destination encoding is a
        stateful encoding such as ISO/IEC 2022, there may legitimately be
        bytes left in <var>pending</var>, which <code>#finish</code> flushes
        out. The lesson is that <code>#finish</code> should always be called
        when there is no more text to transcode.

        <h1 id=primitive-convert>Primitive Conversion</h1>

        <p><code>Encoding::Converter#convert</code> is built atop
        <code>Encoding::Converter#primitive_convert</code>, which provides
        even more control over the process. Unlike <code>#convert</code>, the
        source and destination buffers must be specified explicitly: the
        former as the first argument, the latter as the second. Both should be
        <code>String</code>s holding, respectively, the text to be transcoded,
        and the <code>String</code> in which to store the result. If the
        source buffer is an empty <code>String</code> it may be given as
        <code>nil</code>, instead. Neither buffer can be frozen, as they are,
        respectively, depleted and replenished in the course of the operation.

        <p>Bytes are written from the source buffer to the destination buffer
        via the pending buffer, as with <code>#convert</code>. However, this
        time instead of exceptions being raised for erroneous input, a
        <code>Symbol</code> is returned, as explained subsequently, which
        describes the problem. Thus, the programmer may elect to resolve the
        error before calling <code>#primitive_convert</code> again to resume
        the conversion. Due to the use of the pending buffer,
        <code>Encoding::Converter#finish</code> should still be used, as
        described previously.
        
        <p>By default, the destination buffer is appended to. If an
        <code>Integer</code> offset is given as the third argument to
        <code>#primitive_convert</code>, it specifies the byte index after which
        the transcoded text should be written. An <code>ArgumentError</code> is
        raised if the offset is given and greater than the byte size of the
        destination buffer. If this argument is specified as <code>nil</code>,
        the default behaviour is followed. 
        
        <p>An optional fourth argument, given as an <code>Integer</code>,
        specifies the maximum size in bytes of the destination buffer; by
        default this value is <code>nil</code> which denotes an absence of a
        limit. If this limit is non-<code>nil</code> and the size of the
        destination buffer reaches it, transcoding will stop and
        <code>:destination_buffer_full</code> will be returned.

        <p>An optional fifth argument specifies one or both of the following
        options as a <code>Hash</code> or a bitwise OR of the corresponding
        constants:

        <dl>
          <dt><code>after_output: true</code> / <code>Encoding::Converter::AFTER_OUTPUT</code>
          <dd>After writing a character to the destination buffer, stop, and
          return <code>:after_output</code>.
          <dt><code>partial_input: true</code> / <code>Encoding::Converter::PARTIAL_INPUT</code>
          <dd>The source buffer is known to be incomplete, i.e. it ends outside
          of a character boundary. If this option is given and the last byte(s)
          of the source buffer don’t correspond to a character in the destination
          encoding, <code>:source_buffer_empty</code> is returned. This
          indicates that the remainder of the source text should be assigned to
          the source buffer, and <code>#primitive_convert</code> called again.
        </dl>

        <p>The return value is one of the following <code>Symbol</code>s:

        <dl>
          <dt><code>:invalid_byte_sequence</code>
          <dd>The source buffer contains a byte sequence invalid in the
          destination encoding, regardless of any following bytes. Equivalent
          to the <code>Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError</code> exception
          being raised.
          <dt><code>:incomplete_input</code>
          <dd>The source buffer ends prematurely, presumably prior to a
          character boundary, but is potentially valid if additional input is
          supplied. Nevertheless, this state is regarded as exceptional,
          equivalent to an <code>Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError</code>
          being raised, because the <code>:partial_input</code> option is
          <code>false</code>. If, as expected, no more input is supplied, the
          result will end with an invalid byte sequence. Conversely, if
          <code>:partial_input</code> was <code>true</code>, the unexceptional
          <code>:source_buffer_empty</code> <code>Symbol</code> would be
          returned instead.
          <dt><code>:undefined_conversion</code>
          <dd>A character has been encountered in the source buffer which,
          although legal in the source encoding, has no equivalent in the
          destination encoding. Equivalent to an
          <code>Encoding::UndefinedConversionError</code> exception being
          raised.
          <dt><code>:after_output</code>
          <dd>If the <code>:after_output</code> option is given, after each
          character is converted this <code>Symbol</code> is returned.
          <dt><code>:destination_buffer_full</code>
          <dd>If a non-<code>nil</code> value has been given for the fourth
          argument, this <code>Symbol</code> indicates that the destination
          buffer has reached the given limit.
          <dt><code>:source_buffer_empty</code>
          <dd>The source buffer ends prematurely, presumably prior to a
          character boundary, and the <code>:partial_input</code> option has
          been given. The source buffer should be replenished and transcoding
          resumed.
          <dt><code>:finished</code>
          <dd>Conversion is finished, either naturally or because
          <code>Encoding::Converter#finish</code> has been called.
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1 id=error-context>Error Context</h1>
        
        <p>When an error occurs during transcoding, it is often necessary to
        understand its context so as to recover. The exceptions raised by
        <code>#convert</code>, are augmented with accessors for gleaning this
        information. Additionally,
        <code>Encoding::Converter#primitive_errinfo</code> provides detailed
        information about the last error in the form of an <code>Array</code>
        with the following elements, in this order:

        <ol>
          <li>The <code>Symbol</code> that <code>#primitive_convert</code>
          would have returned in this situation, even if <code>#convert</code>
          was the actual method used. The six possible values were
          described above. If this element is <code>:after_output</code>,
          <code>:destination_buffer_full</code>,
          <code>:source_buffer_empty</code>, or <code>:finished</code>, all
          remaining elements are <code>nil</code>.
          <li>The source encoding as a <code>String</code>. This may not be
          the given source encoding if the conversion path has multiple steps.
          Equivalent to the <code>#source_encoding_name</code> methods of
          <code>Encoding::UndefinedConversionError</code> and
          <code>Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError</code>.
          <li>The destination encoding as a <code>String</code>. This may not be
          the given destination encoding if the conversion path has multiple steps.
          Equivalent to the <code>#destination_encoding_name</code> methods of
          <code>Encoding::UndefinedConversionError</code> and
          <code>Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError</code>.
          <li>The problematic bytes as a <code>String</code>: the bytes prior
          to the invalid byte for <code>:invalid_byte_sequence</code>, the errant character
          for <code>:undefined_conversion</code>, and the bytes read since the
          last character for <code>:incomplete_input</code>. Equivalent to
          <code>Encoding::UndefinedConversionError#error_char</code> and
          <code>Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError#error_bytes</code>.
          <li>For <code>:invalid_byte_sequence</code>, this element holds the
          byte that rendered the sequence invalid. i.e. the preceding element
          held the bytes which could legitimately form a valid sequence, and
          this element holds the byte which invalidated it. This is equivalent
          to <code>Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError#readagain_bytes</code>. For
          <code>:undefined_conversion</code> and
          <code>:incomplete_input</code>, this element is <code>""</code>.
        </ol>

        <p>So, error context can be ascertained, <i>ex post facto</i>, by
        using <code>#convert</code>, then rescuing and examining the
        exceptions it raises, or by using either transcoding method and
        inspecting elements of the <code>#primitive_errinfo</code>
        <code>Array</code>. A third approach is to use
        <code>#last_error</code>, which returns the exception
        <code>#convert</code> would have raised, or otherwise
        <code>nil</code>. This saves one from having to rescue exceptions or
        splice an <code>Array</code>, if his interest is purely the
        exceptional situations. It also suggests a useful idiom for dealing
        with errors: it is true the error indicates malformed input;
        otherwise, it relates to the configuration of the transcoder.

        <p>Recall, however, that the states <code>:incomplete_input</code> and
        <code>:invalid_byte_sequence</code> both indicate that an invalid byte
        sequence has been discovered-the former is simply optimistic that the
        next input will correct it-so both have
        <code>Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError</code> as their exception.
        They can be distinguished with the
        <code>Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceError#incomplete_input?</code>
        predicate, which only returns <code>true</code> in the former case.

      <section>
        <h1 id=invalid-byte-sequence-recovery>Recovery from an Invalid Byte Sequence</h1>

        <p>When an invalid byte sequence is encountered, the transcoder saves
        two sets of bytes: the <i>error bytes</i> and the <i>read-again
          bytes</i>. The former are always discarded: they are, independently
        of context, invalid in the destination encoding. The latter are the
        buffered bytes that followed. If this error is simply ignored, and the
        call to <code>#primitive_convert</code> repeated, the read-again bytes
        are returned to the source buffer, and considered again. If this new
        byte sequence is valid in the destination encoding, it will be
        transcoded as normal. Otherwise, this process will be repeated. The
        outcome is almost certainly undesirable. Invalid byte sequences are
        split, and some of their constituent bytes are interpreted as
        characters in their own right, and appended to the destination
        buffer.</p>

        <figure id=ignoring-invalid-byte-sequence.rb>
          <figcaption>Ignoring an invalid byte sequence error is likely to
          introduce garbage characters into the result.
        </figure>

        <p>The safer option is to drop the read-again bytes, too, with
        <code>Encoding::Converter#putback</code>. Optionally, the maximum
        number of bytes to put back can be given as an <code>Integer</code>
        argument. To contrast the two approaches, juxtapose the previous
        example with the following, taking care to note the final contents of
        <var>dest</var>.</p>

        <figure id=putback-invalid-byte-sequence.rb>
          <figcaption>Invalid byte sequence errors can be recovered from by
          putting back the read-again bytes.
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1 id=undefined-conversion-recover>Recovery from an Undefined Conversion Error</h1>

        <p>Again, this error can be ignored by simply repeating the call to
        <code>#primitive_convert</code>. The unknown character will be
        dropped, and transcoding will continue. A more refined approach is to
        substitute the unknown character for another: either a constant, such
        as <code>"?"</code>, or an approximation determined out-of-band. To
        support both scenarios, <code>Encoding::Converter#insert_output</code>
        accepts an arbitrary <code>String</code> argument, which it appends to
        the source buffer on the next call to <code>#primitive_convert</code>.
        Accordingly, the <code>String</code> will be transcoded into the
        target encoding and appended to the destination buffer.</p>

        <figure id=insert-output.rb>
          <figcaption>Arbitrary text can be substituted for undefined
          characters.
