    <p>A <code>Regexp</code> represents a pattern that describes a
    <code>String</code>. It <i>matches</i> when contained by the former. The
    literal is of the form
    <code>/<var>pattern</var>/<var>options</var></code>: a pattern delimited
    by solidi, followed by zero or more option specifiers.</p>

    </figure>
    
    <p>The pattern consists of literal characters and meta-characters. A
    literal character is a non-meta-character; it matches itself. Prefixing a
    meta-character with a reverse solidus causes it to match literally.
    <!-- List the meta-characters explicitly? -->
    
    <p>A balanced pair of parentheses are meta-characters which group and/or
    capture the characters they enclose. Grouping allows the enclosed to be
    treated as an atomic whole such that meta-characters directly following
    the closing parenthesis act on the whole. Capturing is the extraction of
    specific parts of the text being matched so it can be referred to later,
    from within the pattern <!-- Mention backreferences? --> or the
    surrounding program. Parentheses do not capture if the opening parenthesis
    is directly followed by <code>?:</code>. Captures can be referred to by
    name if the opening parenthesis is followed by
    <code>?&lt;<var>name</var>&gt;</code>.  Alternatively, they can be
    referred to by number, where the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> group of
    parentheses is numbered <var>n</var>.
    
    <p>A literal character or parenthetical may be followed by a quantifier
    meta-character which specifies how many consecutive occurrences are
    required at that point in the pattern. <code>+</code> requires at least
    one, <code>*</code> zero or more, and
    <code>{<var>min</var>,<var>max</var>}</code> between <var>min</var> and
    <var>max</var> times. <!-- Note that one of these can be omitted? -->
    
    <p>A character class specifies a set of characters, one of which must
    appear at that point in the pattern, enclosed within a pair of square
    brackets. The characters are specified literally, one after the other. A
    range of consecutive characters may be abbreviated with the notation
    <code><var>start</var>-<var>end</var></code>: the first character in the
    range separated from the last by a hyphen. Inside a character class the
    hyphen is therefore a metacharacter, so to be matched literally must
    appear immediately before the right square bracket.
    
    <p>There are pre-defined character classes to match alphabetical
    characters (<code>[[:alpha:]]</code>), lowercase
    (<code>[[:lower:]]</code>), uppercase (<code>[[:upper:]]</code>),
    alphanumerics (<code>[[:alnum:]]</code>), digits
    (<code>[[:digit:]]</code>), whitespace (<code>[[:space:]]</code>), and
    punctuation (<code>[[:punct:]]</code>), among others. The period matches
    any character except newline.
    
    <p>A vertical line is a meta-character specifying that either the
    expression to its right, or that to its left, must match. It is usually used
    inside a parenthetical.
    
    <p><code>String#match</code> returns a <code>MatchData</code> object if
    the match succeeded; <code>nil</code> otherwise. <code>MatchData#[]</code>
    returns the text captured by the capture group given as a
    <code>Symbol</code>, for a named group, or an <code>Integer</code>.</p>

      <h1 id=regexp-encoding>Encoding</h1>

      <p>A <code>Regexp</code> is associated with an encoding which must be
      compatible with that of the <code>String</code> it is matched against.
      By default a <code>Regexp</code> has the same encoding as the source
      file in which it is contained, with the following exceptions:

      <ul>
        <li>An ASCII-only Regexp has the encoding US-ASCII when the source
        encoding is ASCII-compatible.
        <li>An encoding option has been specified, in which case the
        corresponding encoding is used, as follows:
          <dl class=inline>
            <dt><code>u</code><dd>UTF-8
            <dt><code>e</code><dd>EUC-JP
            <dt><code>s</code><dd>Windows-31J
            <dt><code>n</code><dd>ASCII-8BIT
          </dl>
        <li>The use of Unicode character escapes within a pattern force the
        <code>Regexp</code> to have UTF-8 encoding.
      </ul>

      <p>In addition to the single-letter encoding options described above, a
      <code>Regexp</code> can be encoded in any supporting encoding. This
      requires the <code>Regexp</code> to be constructed with
      <code>Regexp.new</code>, passing it the pattern as a <code>String</code>
      associated with the desired encoding. The same technique, <i>mutatis
        mutandis</i>, can be used with <code>String#force_encoding</code> to
      associate the <code>Regexp</code> with a different encoding.</p>

      <figure id=regexp-specify-encoding.rb>
        <figcaption>Initially, this <code>Regexp</code> adopts the source
        encoding. Passing <code>Regexp.new</code> the pattern encoded as
        ISO-8859-1 creates a regexp with the same pattern and the given
        encoding.
      </figure>

      <section>
        <h1 id=regexp-fixed-encoding>Fixed Encoding</h1>

        <p>The encoding of a <code>Regexp</code> is said to be <dfn
          title='fixed encoding'>fixed</dfn> if its encoding and/or pattern is
        incompatible with ASCII. This is significant because a
        <code>Regexp</code> with a non-fixed encoding can match any
        <code>String</code> whose encoding is ASCII-compatible. The
        <code>Regexp#fixed_encoding?</code> predicate returns
        <code>true</code> if its receiver’s encoding is fixed;
        <code>false</code> otherwise.

    <h1 id=symbols>Symbols</h1>

    <p>A <code>Symbol</code> is an immutable immediate representing an
    identifier. Two symbols with the same content will always be represented
    by the same object, e.g. <code>:glark.object_id ==
      :glark.object_id</code>, so symbol comparisons are extremely efficient.
    However, <code>Symbol</code> objects are not
    garbage collected, so are unsuitable for storing data from unbounded
    collections; use <code>String</code>s instead. <code>Symbol</code>s are
    used for unique identifiers, such as <code>Hash</code> keys, as message
    selectors and method names, and as a substitute for constants.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>A <code>Symbol</code> literal consists of a colon (<code class=u
      title=':'>U＋003A</code>) followed by a symbol or <code>String</code>
    literal. A symbol is an <a
      href=/programs#identifiers>identifier</a>-optionally followed by
    <code>=</code>, <code>?</code>, or <code>!</code>-an <a
      href=/messages#operators>operator method selector</a>, <code>[]</code>,
    or <code>[]=</code>. The
    <code>%s<var>delimiter</var>…<var>delimiter</var></code> construct enables
    symbols to be specified between arbitrary delimiters along the same lines
    as <a href=#single-quoted-strings-q><code>%q</code></a>.</p>

    <p>A <code>Symbol</code> may also be created from a <code>String</code>
    with <code>String#to_sym</code>, but see the remark below regarding
    invalid encoding.</p>

    <section>
      <h1 id=symbol-encoding>Encoding</h1>

      <p>A <code>Symbol</code> is associated with an encoding, but it cannot
      be manipulated directly. <code>Symbol</code> literals adopt the source
      encoding of the file in which they are used. If they consist exclusively
      of ASCII characters, they have the encoding US-ASCII. If a
      <code>Symbol</code> is created from a <code>String</code>, either via
      the <code>:<var>string</var></code> syntax or
      <code>String#to_sym</code>, they have the encoding of that
      <code>String</code>. Therefore, to create a <code>Symbol</code> with a
      given encoding, first create a <code>String</code> with that encoding,
      then convert that <code>String</code> to a <code>Symbol</code>.

      <p>The encoding of a <code>Symbol</code> must always be <a
        href=#valid-encoding>valid</a>.  Therefore, attempting to convert a
      <code>String</code> with invalid encoding to a <code>Symbol</code>,
      causes an <code>EncodingError</code> to be raised.
