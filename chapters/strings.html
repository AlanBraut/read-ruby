      <p><dfn>Here documents</dfn> extend the concept of alternative
      delimiters to allow an arbitrary <em>sequence</em> of characters
      as a delimiter. They begin with <code>&lt;&lt;</code> followed
      immediately by an arbitrary identifier or string literal. Their
      content begins on the following line and continues until that
      same identifier/string is seen on a line by itself with no
      intervening whitespace. If there is a hyphen between the
      opening <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and the delimiter, i.e.
      <code>&lt;&lt;-<var>delimiter</var></code>, the closing
      delimiter may be preceded with whitespace. The final newline
      character before the closing delimiter is part of the here
      document’s contents: a minimal here document is equivalent to
      <code>"\n"</code>.
      
      <p>If the delimiter is an identifier or double quoted string,
      the contents of the here document is interpreted with
      double-quoted string semantics. Otherwise, the here document’s
      contents are interpreted literally: all escape sequences and
      interpolation constructs are ignored.</p>

    <p><i>Character</i> is defined by the ISO/IEC as <q>A member of a set of
      elements used for the organisation, control, or representation of
      data.</q> (<a href=/references#refTR15285><cite>Information technology —
        An operational model for characters and glyphs</cite></a>). The
    <i>set</i> of which they are members is an encoding. Therefore, in Ruby, a
    character is a specific byte sequence interpreted according to a given
    encoding. An implication is that by changing the encoding of a
    <code>String</code>, one also changes what characters it contains.</p>

    syntax, e.g. <code>'l'</code>, or via a <dfn>character literal</dfn>. The
    latter comprises a question mark followed by a single character, i.e.
    <code>?<var>char</var></code>, where <var>char</var> is a literal
    character, or a <a href=#character-escapes>character escape</a> that
    results in a single character, such as <code>\u<var>hex</var></code>,
    <code>\n</code>, <code>\t</code>, or a byte escape.
    <code>?<var>char</var></code> is entirely equivalent to
    <code>"<var>char</var>"</code>. To create a character for a given
    codepoint, see <a href=#codepoints>Codepoints</a>.

    <p><code>String#chars</code>, and its alias <code>String#each_char</code>,
    return an <code>Enumerator</code> of the receiver’s characters. Both yield
    each character in turn if a block is given.

    <p>A <code>String</code> may be treated as an <code>Array</code> of
    characters with <a href=#substrings><code>String#[]</code></a>. However,
    <a href=/references#refFLAN08>Flanagan et al.</a> suggest that the
    aforementioned enumerators <q>may be more efficient</q> when processing a
    <code>String</code> character-by-character (pp. 58)

    <h1 id=bytes>Bytes</h1>

    <p>Fundamentally a <code>String</code> is an array of bytes. An ordered
    sequence of numbers, each of which is in the range 0&ndash;255. Bytes have
    no inherent meaning, so are typically used in conjunction with a
    scheme that ascribes them semantics or values. In the case of a binary
    data format, this scheme may be embodied in a program’s algorithms, or be
    otherwise out-of-band. For textual data, this scheme is termed an <a
      href=#encoding>encoding</a>. 

    <p>Byte-level access generally assumes, but does not enforce, that the
    <code>String</code>’s encoding is <a
      href=/encoding#ascii-8bit>ASCII-8BIT</a>. Explicitly manipulating byte
    sequences in a <code>String</code> containing text is at best ill-advised.
    It breaks the abstraction of an encoding, and may result in
    <code>String</code>s with invalid encodings and spurious exceptions being
    raised.
    
    <code>String#bytes</code>, and its alias <code>String#each_byte</code>,
    return an <code>Enumerator</code> of their receiver’s bytes, represented
    as <code>Fixnum</code>s. A specific byte position may be assigned to with
    <code>String#setbyte(<var>index</var>, <var>byte</var>)</code>, where
    <var>index</var> is the zero-based offset of the byte to be changed, and
    <var>byte</var> is the new value as an <code>Integer</code>. A byte may be
    retrieved from a given offset with
    <code>String#getbyte(<var>index</var>)</code>. The length of a
    <code>String</code> in bytes is returned by <code>String#bytesize</code>
    as an <code>Integer</code>.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id=codepoints>Codepoints</h1>

    <p>Unicode assigns each character in its repertoire a unique integer
    <dfn>codepoint</dfn>. This identifies a character, irrespective of its
    encoding. It is typically represented with the
    notation <code class=u>U＋<var>hex</var></code>, where <var>hex</var> is
    the codepoint in uppercase hexadecimal digits. For example, <code class=u
      title='Ď'>U＋010E</code> is the codepoint for Ď (<i>Latin Capital Letter
      D with Carron</i>). In the UTF-8 encoding this character is represented
    by the byte sequence <code>"\xc4\x8e"</code>, in EUC-JP it is represented
    as <code>"\x8f\xaa\xb0"</code>, and in ISO-8859-2 it is simply
    <code>"\xcf"</code>. However, all three cases represent the same
    character, so all three consist of the codepoint 270.

    <p>The Unicode character escape allows a character with a given codepoint
    to be embedded into a <code>String</code>. Similarly,
    <code>Integer#chr(<var>encoding</var>)</code> interprets its receiver as a
    codepoint in the named encoding, and returns the corresponding character.
    If the codepoint does not exist in the given encoding, an
    <code>ArgumentError</code> is raised.

    <p>Conversely, <code>String#ord</code> returns the codepoint of the first
    character in its receiver as an <code>Integer</code>. More generally,
    <code>String#codepoints</code>, and its alias
    <code>String#each_codepoint</code>, return an <code>Enumerator</code> of
    their receiver’s codepoints represented as <code>Integer</code>s. If given
    a block, each codepoint is yielded to it in turn. All three methods will
    raise an <code>ArgumentError</code> if their receiver has an invalid
    encoding.

    <h1 id=size>Size</h1>

    <p>“How long is a piece of string.” isn’t always a rhetorical question,
    but in Ruby the answer depends on your unit of measurement.
    <code>String#length</code>, and its alias <code>String#size</code>, return
    the number of characters in their receiver. Therefore, they are dependent
    on the associated encoding: the length of a <code>String</code> may change
    simply by associating it with a different encoding.
    <code>String#bytesize</code>, however, returns the number of bytes
    contained in its receiver. It is unaffected by
    <code>String#force_encoding</code>.

    <p>A <code>String</code> is <dfn title='empty string'>empty</dfn> if it
    has a length of <code>0</code>. This can be tested with the predicate
    <code>String#empty?</code>, and effected with the destructive
    <code>String#clear</code>.

    <h1 id=equivalence>Equivalence</h1>

    <p>For two <code>String</code>s to compare as equal in terms of
    <code>String#==</code> they must be byte-wise identical and associated
    with the same encoding. This last condition is dropped when both
    <code>String</code>s consist entirely of ASCII characters and have an
    ASCII-compatible encoding. If the second operand responds to the implicit
    conversion protocol of <code>#to_str</code>, it is converted thus, then
    the result is tested for equivalence with the receiver.
    <code>String#eql?</code> behaves in the same manner, but does not attempt
    to convert its operand.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id=comparison>Comparison</h1>

    <p><code>String#&lt;=&gt;</code> compares its receiver with its
    <code>String</code> argument in terms of their character codes. Neither
    operand is normalised. <code>String</code> mixes in
    <code>Comparable</code>, so gains <code>String#&lt;</code>,
    <code>String#&le;</code>, <code>String#&gt;</code>, and
    <code>String#&ge;</code>, also.

    <p>The aforementioned methods are, by implication, case sensitive.
    <code>String#casecmp</code> provides a case-insensitive alternative for
    ASCII <code>String</code>s; non-ASCII characters are compared as
    above. Alternatively, one must normalise the case of the two
    <code>String</code>s themselves before comparing them.</p>

    <h1 id=concatenation>Concatenation</h1>

    <p><code>String#+</code> returns its receiver concatenated with its
    <code>String</code> argument, without modifying the former. No coercion
    is performed on the argument.

    <p><code>String#&lt;&lt;</code>, and its alias <code>String#concat</code>,
    append their argument to their receiver, mutating the existing object
    rather than creating a new one, and return the receiver. The argument must
    be either an <code>Integer</code> codepoint, which is converted into the
    corresponding character before concatenation, or a
    <code>String</code>.</p>

    <figure id=string-concat.rb>

    <p>Either approach requires at least one of the following conditions to
    hold:

    <ul>
      <li>Both encodings are ASCII-compatible and one of the
      <code>String</code>s is ASCII-only.
      <li>One of the <code>String</code>s is empty.

  <section>
    <h1 id=substrings>Substrings</h1>

    <p><code>String#[]</code>, and its alias <code>String#slice</code>,
    provide access to specific portions of a <code>String</code>, allowing it
    to be treated as an array of characters. 
    
    <p>An <code>Integer</code> argument, <var>i</var>, returns the
    <var>i</var><sup>th</sup> character, where the first character has the
    index <code>0</code>. If <var>i</var> is negative, it counts backward from
    the last character, so <code>String#[-2]</code> returns the penultimate
    character.

    <p>When two <code>Integer</code> arguments are given,
    <code>String#[<var>i</var>, <var>l</var>]</code>, the <var>l</var>
    characters are starting from index <var>i</var> are returned. <var>i</var>
    may be negative, with the same semantics as before, but <var>l</var>
    cannot be.     
    
    <p>When the argument is a <code>Range</code>,
    <code>String#[<var>i</var>..<var>j</var>]</code>, a substring beginning at
    index <var>i</var> and ending at index <var>j</var> is returned.

    <p>A <code>String</code> argument is returned if contained in the
    receiver. Likewise, when a <code>Regexp</code> argument is given, whose
    pattern matches the receiver, the return value is the first matching
    substring. The latter may be accompanied by a second argument indicating
    the group of captured text to return: an <code>Integer</code> refers to
    the numbered group, a <code>Symbol</code> or <code>String</code> refers to
    the named group. However, if a group is specified but the pattern fails to
    match, an <code>IndexError</code> is raised.

    <p>If the receiver does not contain the given substring, <code>nil</code>
    is returned. If it does, <code>String#[]=</code> may also be used as an
    lvalue with any of the above forms. The result is that the substring
    returned is replaced in the receiver with the rvalue. For example,
    <code>'ab'[0] = ?b</code> returns <code>"bb"</code>.</p>

    <figure id=substrings.rb>
      <figcaption>Slicing a <code>String</code> into substrings
    </figure>

    <p><code>String#insert(<var>i</var>, <var>s</var>)</code> is equivalent to
    <code>String#[<var>i</var>] = <var>s</var></code>. However, in addition to
    modifying its receiver, <code>#insert</code> returns the new
    <code>String</code>, as opposed to <code>#[]=</code> which returns
    <var>s</var>.

    <p><code>String#slice!</code> accepts all the same combinations of
    arguments, but deletes the substring from the receiver.

    <p><code>String#index</code> returns the first zero-based index of the
    matched substring, as opposed to the substring itself. The substring may
    be given as a <code>String</code> argument, and optionally followed by an
    <code>Integer</code> specifying the index to search from. If a
    <code>Regexp</code> argument is provided instead, the index of the start
    of the match is returned. By contrast, <code>String#rindex</code> accepts
    the same arguments but returns the index of the rightmost match. When no
    matching substring is found, <code>nil</code> is returned.</p>

    <figure id=string-index.rb>
      <figcaption>Finding the offset of an occurrence of a substring
    </figure>

    <p><code>String#[]</code> can be used to test for the presence of a
    substring on account of its returning <code>nil</code> when the substring
    is not present. A slightly clearer approach is
    <code>String#include?</code>, which returns <code>true</code> if its
    <code>String</code> argument is contained within the receiver;
    <code>false</code> otherwise. <code>String#start_with?</code> and
    <code>String#end_with?</code> behave similarly, but require the substring
    to be located at the beginning or end, respectively, of the receiver.</p>

    <h1 id=searching>Searching &amp; Replacing</h1>

    <p><code>String#sub(<var>r</var>, <var>s</var>)</code> replaces the first
    occurrence of a <code>Regexp</code>, <var>r</var>, with a
    <code>String</code>, <var>s</var>, then returns the new
    <code>String</code>. <var>s</var> may contain back-references to capture
    groups in the pattern, which are substituted for the corresponding match.
    In a single-quoted <code>String</code> a numbered group is referenced as
    <code>\<var>d</var></code>, where <var>d</var> is the group number, while
    <code>\k&lt;<var>n</var>&gt;</code> references the capture group named
    <var>n</var>. In a double-quoted <code>String</code> the reverse solidus
    must be doubled, i.e. <code>\\<var>d</var></code> and
    <code>\\k&lt;<var>n</var>&gt;</code>.

    <p>The first argument can be given as a <code>String</code> instead of a
    <code>Regexp</code>, in which case it is treated like a pattern with the
    metacharacters escaped. Therefore, this form is similar to
    <code>String#[<var>r</var>] = <var>s</var></code>.

    <p>If the second argument is omitted, a block must be supplied. It is
    passed the matched text and must return the replacement
    <code>String</code>. If it is a <code>Hash</code> that has the match as a
    key, the replacement <code>String</code> is the corresponding value.

    <p>To replace all occurrences of a pattern use <code>String#gsub</code>
    instead, with the arguments described above. If <code>String#gsub</code>
    is called with neither a replacement <code>String</code> nor a block, it
    returns an <code>Enumerator</code>.

    <p>The <code>String#sub!</code> and <code>String#gsub!</code> variants
    behave identically to their unadorned equivalents except they modify the
    receiver in-place. If the substitution succeeded, the return value is the
    receiver; otherwise, it is <code>nil</code>.</p>

      courses'.split</code> returns <code>['Horses', 'for', 'courses']</code>.
    If a <code>String</code> or <code>Regexp</code> argument is given, that is
    used as the delimiter. The delimiter is omitted from the results.

    <p><code>String#partition</code> also requires a <code>String</code> or
    <code>Regexp</code> argument specifying a delimiter. It always returns a
    three-element <code>Array</code> comprising the text preceding the first
    occurrence of the delimiter, the delimiter itself, then the text following
    the first occurrence of the delimiter.  <code>String#rpartition</code>
    behaves similarly except it uses the last occurrence of the delimiter.</p>

    characters are converted to uppercase, and vice versa.
    <code>String#capitalize</code> converts its receiver to lowercase then
    converts its first character to uppercase. All four methods have a
    corresponding bang method which modifies the receiver in-place. However,
    these methods only understand the capitalization of ASCII characters; any
    other character is left unchanged.  Case-insensitive comparison was

      <h1 id=associate>Forcing an Association</h1>

      <p>The encoding associated with a <code>String</code> may be changed
      independently of its contents. This is necessary if the contents are
      valid in one encoding, but associated with another. Transcoding would
      be inappropriate because it would alter the underlying bytes, which
      are already perfectly valid. The solution is the destructive method
      <code>String#force_encoding</code>, which associates its receiver with
      the encoding given as an argument. This operation will always succeed,
      even if the <code>String</code>’s contents are <a
        href=#valid-encoding>invalid</a> in the new encoding.

      <p>Yui Naruse, a member of the Ruby core team, cautions against the
      use of this method: <q><code>String#force_encoding</code> should be
        sparsely used since Strings have already had appropriate encodings
        assigned when those are created, or read from files specifying the
        encoding.&hellip; If you need to use
      <code>String#force_encoding</code> in your library, you should
      reconsider your library design. You should not use this method
      thoughtlessly.</q> (<a href=/references#refHARADA09 class=ref><cite>The Design and

      <p>A <code>String</code>’s encoding is <dfn title='valid

      according to the encoding it is associated with. This check makes no
      claims as to whether the characters in the <code>String</code> exist
      in the encoding, for it inspects syntax rather than semantics.

      <p>In general, if you create a <code>String</code> via a literal, or
      consume a <code>String</code> as input that is validly encoded,
      manipulating it as a sequence of characters will ensure its encoding
      remains valid.  However, associating a <code>String</code> with an
      improper encoding, treating it as <a href=#byte-arrays>byte array</a>,
      or consuming garbage input, may all result in an invalid encoding. The
      <code>String#valid_encoding?</code> predicate returns
      <code>true</code> if the <code>String</code>’s encoding is valid;
      <code>false</code> otherwise.

      For example, two <code>String</code>s with disparate encodings are <a

    <h1 id=format>Format Strings</h1>

    <p>A <dfn>format string</dfn> is a template specifying how a set of
    arguments should be interpolated into a new <code>String</code>. It
    contains arbitrary text-which is copied to the result
    unchanged-interspersed with <dfn>format sequences</dfn>-which describe
    how their corresponding argument should be converted before being
    substituted in their place.

    <p><code>String#%</code> interprets its receiver as a format string, and
    its argument-a plurality are supplied as an <code>Array</code>-as the
    values to be interpolated, returning the expanded <code>String</code>.
    <code>Kernel#sprintf</code>, and its alias <code>Kernel#format</code>,
    interpret their first argument as a format string and subsequent arguments
    as the values to be interpolated.

    <p>A format sequence begins with a percent sign, then contains zero or
    more single-character <var>flags</var>, an optional minimal field <a
      href=#sprintf-width><var>width</var></a>, an optional <a
      href=#sprintf-precision><var>precision</var></a>, and a mandatory
    conversion specifier, in that order. We will discuss each conversion
    specifier in turn, along with the flags they support, then conclude by
    explaining the other fields.</p>

      <h1 id=sprintf-text>Textual Conversions</h1>

      <p>Firstly, the following text-based conversion specifiers are available:

      <dl>
        <dt>Character
        <dd>Conversion specifier <code>c</code> interprets a numerical
        argument as a character code point, which it converts into the given
        character. An argument consisting of a one-character
        <code>String</code> is copied into the result unchanged.

        <dt>Inspect
        <dd>Conversion specifier <code>p</code> is substituted for the
        result of sending <code>#inspect</code> to its argument.

        <dt>String
        <dd>Conversion specifier <code>s</code> copies the argument into
        the result as a <code>String</code>.
      </dl>

      <p>If accompanied by a precision, both <code>p</code> and
      <code>s</code> copy at most <var>precision</var> characters into the

        <figcaption>Using the text-based format sequences.

    </section>

    <p>The remaining conversion specifiers format numbers. All support a
    <code>␣</code> (a space character) flag, which prepends positive results
    with a space, a <code>+</code> flag which prepends a plus sign to
    positive results, and a <code>0</code> flag which <a
      href=#sprintf-width>pads</a> fields with zeros instead of spaces. If
    <code>␣</code> and <code>+</code> are used together, the latter has
    precedence.</p>

    <section>
      <h1 id=sprintf-bases>Converting Between Numerical Bases</h1>

      <p>Conversion specifiers can convert an argument into an integer in a
      given base. Negative results are usually represented in two’s
      complement, prefixed with two full stops. However, if the
      <code>␣</code> flag is supplied they are given in their absolute form
      and prefixed with a hyphen-minus sign. When the <code>0</code> flag is
      given and the result is represented as two’s complement, it is padded
      with the digit one fewer than the base. For example, negative octal
      numbers are padded with <code>7</code>s instead of <code>0</code>s.

      <dl>
        <dt>Binary
        <dd>Conversion specifiers <code>b</code> and <code>B</code>
        convert their argument to base 2. The <code>#</code> flag causes
        <code>0b</code> to be prepended to the result of <code>b</code>, and
        <code>0B</code> to be prepended to the result of <code>B</code>,
        i.e. these conversion specifiers differ only in the case of their
        prefix.
        
        <dt>Octal
        <dd>The <code>o</code> conversion specifier converts its argument to
        base 8. When this conversion specifier is used in conjunction with
        the <code>#</code> flag, and the result is positive, <code>0</code>
        is prepended to the result. 

        <dt>Decimal 
        <dd>Conversion specifiers <code>i</code>, <code>u</code>, and
        <code>d</code>, all of which are identical, convert their argument
        to base 10. Negative numbers are prefixed with a hyphen-minus sign.

        <dt>Hexadecimal 
        <dd>Both the <code>x</code> and <code>X</code> conversion specifiers
        convert their argument to base 16. The case of the conversion
        specifier dictates the case of the characters in the result. The
        <code>#</code> flag prepends <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code> to
        the result, as appropriate.

      <h1 id=sprint-notation>Numerical Notation</h1>

      <p>The notation used for displaying numerical arguments can also be
      configured with conversion specifiers. The <code>␣</code> flag again
      causes positive results to have a single space prepended, but has no
      effect on negative results. The <code>#</code> flag forces the result
      to contain a radix point, even if no digits follow. 
      
      <dl>
        <dt>Exponential
        <dd>The <code>e</code> conversion specifier represents the argument
        in exponential notation in the form: <code>[-]<var
            class=l>α</var>.<var class=l>β</var>e±<var
            class=l>γ</var></code>, where <var class=l>α</var> is a single
        digit, <var class=l>β</var> is the fractional part consisting of
        <var>precision</var> (default: 6)  digits, and <var class=l>γ</var>
        is the two-digit exponent.The <code>E</code> conversion specifier
        behaves identically, expect a capital <code>E</code> is used to
        introduce the exponent. 

        <dt>Fixed-point
        <dd>The <var>f</var> conversion specifier represents its argument
        with a whole part, preceded with a hyphen-minus sign if negative,
        and a fractional part, separated by a radix point. There are always
        <var>precision</var> (default: 6) digits following the radix point.

        <dt>Exponential or fixed-point
        <dd>Both the <code>g</code> and <code>G</code> conversion specifiers
        render their argument in the notation most appropriate for its
        magnitude: exponential if the exponent is &lt; -4 or &ge;
        <var>precision</var>; fixed-point, otherwise. There are at most
        <var>precision</var> (default: 6) digits in the result.
        Trailing zeros are omitted from the fractional part of the result
        unless the <code>#</code> flag is given. The radix point is omitted
        unless followed by at least one digit. The exponent is introduced
        with <code>e</code> if the <code>g</code> conversion specifier is
        used; or <code>E</code> if <code>G</code> is used instead.

        <dt>Hexadecimal exponential 
        <dd>A conversion specifier of <code>a</code> converts the argument
        to base-16 exponential notation (using lowercase digits) in the
        form: <code>[-]0x<var class=l>α</var>.<var class=l>β</var>p±<var
            class=l>γ</var></code>, where <var class=l>α</var> is a single
        hex digit, <var class=l>β</var> is one or more hex digits, whose
        quantity is capped at <var>precision</var>, and <var class=l>γ</var>
        is the single-digit decimal exponent. If the <code>A</code>
        specifier is used instead, the lowercase characters in the result
        are converted to uppercase, i.e. it takes the form <code>[-]0X<var
            class=l>α</var>.<var class=l>β</var>P±<var
            class=l>γ</var></code>, where <var class=l>α</var> and <var
          class=l>β</var> use uppercase digits.

      <h1 id=sprintf-hash>Interpolating a <code>Hash</code></h1>

      <p>If the arguments are given as a <code>Hash</code>, rather than an
      <code>Array</code>, they may be referenced from a format sequence by
      name instead of position. When a conversion specifier is immediately
      preceeded by <code>&lt;<var>key</var>&gt;</code>, where <var>key</var>
      names a key of the <code>Hash</code>, the corresponding value in the
      <code>Hash</code> becomes the format sequence’s argument. A format
      sequence with a conversion specifier of of the form
      <code>{<var>name</var>}</code> is equivalent to
      <code>&lt;<var>name</var>&gt;s</code>.</p> 

      <figure id=sprintf-hash.rb>

      <h1 id=sprintf-width>Field Width &amp; Justification</h1>
      
      <p>The <var>width</var> component of a format sequence is an optional
      decimal digit string (with non-zero first digit) specifying the
      minimum width of the field. Alternatively, the value
      can be specified in <a href=#sprintf-arguments>relative or absolute
        terms</a>.
      
      <p>If the result has fewer characters than this width, it is padded;
      if it has more characters, the field is expanded as needed. By
      default, <i>␣</i> (a space character) is used for padding, but the
      <code>0</code> flag causes an alternative character, usually a zero,
      to be used instead. 
      
      <p>Fields are normally right justified, but a flag of <code>-</code>
      justifies left instead. In the former case, padding characters are
      prepended to the result, while in the latter they are appended. If a
      negative width is given, this flag is implied, and the field’s width
      is this value with the sign ignored.</p>

      <h1 id=sprintf-precision>Precision</h1>

      <p>The optional <var>precision</var> component comprises a full stop
      followed by an optional integer. If said integer is omitted or
      negative, it has the value <code>0</code>. Alternatively, the value
      can be specified in <a href=#sprintf-arguments>relative or absolute
        terms</a>. The precision gives:
      
      <ul>
        <li>The minimum number of digits to appear for <code>b</code>,
        <code>B</code>, <code>d</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>o</code>,
        <code>u</code>, <code>x</code>, and <code>X</code> conversions.
        <li>The number of digits to appear after the radix point for
        <code>a</code>,  <code>A</code>,  <code>e</code>,  <code>E</code>,
        <code>f</code>, and <code>F</code> conversions.
        <li>The maximum number of significant digits for <code>g</code> and
        <code>G</code> conversions.
        <li>The maximum number of characters to be taken from a string for
        <code>s</code> and <code>p</code> conversions.

      <h1 id=sprintf-arguments>Relative &amp; Absolute Arguments</h1>

      <p>Usually, an argument is mapped to a conversion specifier
      implicitly: the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> argument corresponds to the
      <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> conversion specifier. However, this may be
      made explicit so as to support arguments in a different order to their
      conversion specifiers, and/or to use the same argument multiple times.

      <p>Arguments are indexed with integers, the first argument having an
      index of 1. To marry a conversion specifier with an argument at index
      <var>i</var>, the format sequence should begin with
      <code>%<var>i</var>$</code>. However, if one format sequence has this
      form, they all must: numbered and un-numbered conversion specifiers
      cannot be mixed in the same format string.

      <p>The precision and width of a field can be provided in a similar
      way. A width given as <code>*<var>i</var>$</code> or a precision given
      as <code>.*<var>i</var>$</code>, specifies that the value is supplied
      by the argument indexed by <var>i</var>. However, this construct must
      always be paired with numbered conversion specifiers, which as noted
      above, are an all-or-nothing deal.
      
      <p>Alternatively, a width given as a single asterisk, or a precision
      given as <code>.*</code>, denote that the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup>
      argument holds <em>their</em> value, rather than that of their
      conversion specifier.  These constructs can be intermixed freely with
      unnumbered conversion specifiers.</p>
