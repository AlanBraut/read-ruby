  <h1 id=enumerables>Enumerables</h1>

  <p>Enumerables are objects that represent collections of other objects. They
  are so named because they mix-in the <code>Enumerable</code> module, which
  enhances such objects with powerful methods for manipulating collections. In
  this chapter we will discuss the <code>Enumerable</code> module itself,
  along with the core data structures that employ it: <code>Array</code>,
  <code>Hash</code>, and <code>Range</code>.</p>

  <section>
    <h1 id=arrays>Arrays</h1>
       
    <p>An <code>Array</code> is a mutable, heterogeneous, ordered collection
    of objects, termed <dfn>elements</dfn>, indexed by an <code>Integer</code>
    subscript. Its mutability means that elements can be added to, and removed
    from, the collection at any point in its lifetime, causing the
    <code>Array</code> to expand or contract as needed. In keeping with her
    philosophy of duck-typing, Ruby does not require the elements to have a
    specific type: any permutation of objects may be stored in an
    <code>Array</code>. That each element is indexed by a unique
    <code>Integer</code>, enforces unambiguous order on the collection. </p>

    <p>An <code>Array</code> literal is a comma-separated list of
    expressions enclosed in square brackets (<code>[</code>,
    <code>]</code>). For example, <code>[1, :two, 'three']</code> creates a
    three-element <code>Array</code> object with <code>1</code> as the first
    element.</p>

      <h1 id=array-literal-w>Alternative Delimiters</h1>
                
      <p>The <code>%w<var>delimiter</var>…<var>delimiter</var></code>
      construct is a syntactical shortcut for instantiating an array of
      strings. The delimiters take the same form as those of <a
        href=/strings#single-quoted-q><code>%q</code></a>. The text between
      them is split on whitespace, each substring becoming an
      element on the array. <code>%w</code> interprets its contents with
      single-quoted string semantics; its counterpart, <code>%W</code>,
      behaves in the same way using double-quoted string semantics.</p>

        <code>%w</code> and <code>%W</code> constructs

    <!-- %W{} -->
    <p>Arrays are indexed by integral subscripts, beginning with 0. If the
    subscript is negative it counts backward from the last element (i.e.
    <code>-1</code> refers to the last element). An element with subscript
    <var>index</var> can be retrieved with the element reference syntax:
    <code>Array#[<var>index</var>]</code>. If the index doesn’t exist,
    <code>nil</code> is returned. The index can be assigned to with
    <code>Array#[<var>index</var>]=</code>. However, if <var>index</var> is
    greater than the size of the <code>Array</code>, the intervening elements
    are created with a value of <code>nil</code> before <var>index</var> is
    assigned. This ensures that the largest subscript is always one less than
    the total size of the <code>Array</code>.
       
    <p>Elements are appended to an <code>Array</code> with
    <code>Array#&lt;&lt;</code>; and prepended with
    <code>Array#unshift</code>.
    <code>Array#include?(<var>element</var>)</code> tests whether the array
    contains <var>element</var>. The total number of elements is returned by
    <code>Array#size</code>. <code>Array#each</code> iterates over the array,
    <code>yield</code>ing the next element each time.</p>

      <h1 id=array-coercion>Coercion</h1>

      <p>In <a href=/objects#conversion>Objects: Conversion</a> the
      <code>:to_a</code> and <code>:to_ary</code> messages were introduced for
      converting an object into an <code>Array</code> either explicitly or
      implicitly, respectively. <code>Array.try_convert</code> was introduced
      as a wrapper around <code>:to_ary</code>: it returns its argument
      implicitly converted to an <code>Array</code> if possible, otherwise
      <code>nil</code>. Lastly, <code>Kernel.Array</code> attempts to convert
      its argument to an <code>Array</code> first implicitly, then explicitly.

  <section>
    <h1 id=hashes>Hashes</h1>
      
    <p>A <code>Hash</code> represents a mutable, heterogeneous collection of
    associations between pairs of objects. The collection is indexed by the
    first element of the pair-its <dfn>key</dfn>-which uniquely identifies the
    second element of the pair-its <dfn>value</dfn>. It is ordered by
    insertion<a href=#fn-hash-order>†</a>. For instance, a <code>Hash</code>
    mapping colours to corresponding fruits may include a key-value pair of
    <code>:lemon =&gt; :yellow</code>: <code>:lemon</code> is the key;
    <code>:yellow</code> is the value.</p>


    <figure class=railroad>
      <img id=hash-literal.png>
      <figcaption>Syntax diagram of the hash literal
    </figure>

    <p>A <code>Hash</code> literal consists of a comma-separated list of
    key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces (<code>{</code>, <code>}</code>).
    The key is separated from its value with <code>=&gt;</code>. For example:
    <code>{:age =&gt; 30, :name =&gt; 'Marlo'}</code>. If the key is a
    <code>Symbol</code> literal, the colon with which its prefixed may be made
    its suffix, and <code>=&gt;</code> can be omitted.  The previous example
    can be rewritten as <code>{age: 30, name: 'Marlo'}</code>. (This
    syntactical shortcut is a reason for preferring <code>Symbol</code>
    keys).</p>
    
    <figure class=railroad>
      <img id=hash-member.png>
      <figcaption>Syntax diagram of an element of the hash literal
    </figure>
      
    <p>A value may be retrieved for a given key with the element reference
    syntax: <code>Hash#[<var>key</var>]</code>. A value may be associated with a given
    key with <code>Hash#[<var>key</var>] = <var>value</var></code>. Note that
    as keys are unique, associating a value with an existing key will replace
    the old value with the new. A key’s existence may be determined with
    <code>Hash#key?(<var>key</var>)</code>.
    
    <p>Hashes can be iterated over with <code>Hash#each</code>, which yields a
    key and its associated value on each iteration. Alternatively,
    <code>Hash#each_key</code> and <code>Hash#each_value</code> iterate over
    the keys or values, respectively.
    
    <p>Uses include a dictionary, allowing values to be looked up by key; a
    dispatch table, where the values are <code>Proc</code>s identified by
    their key; and a cache of unique values, taking advantage of the unique
    keys property.</p>

    <section>
      <h1 id=hash-coercion>Coercion</h1>

      <p>An object that responds to <code>:to_hash</code> may be <a
        href=/objects#implicit-conversion>implicitly converted</a> to a
      <code>Hash</code>. <code>Hash[]</code> is another approach. If given an
      object convertible to a <code>Hash</code>, it performs the conversion and
      returns the new <code>Hash</code>; otherwise, when given an even number
      of arguments, it interprets them as key-value pairs-the first argument
      being the first key, the second argument being its corresponding value,
      and so forth-with which it creates a new <code>Hash</code>.
      <code>Hash.try_convert</code> coerces its argument with
      <code>:to_hash</code>, if possible, or returns <code>nil</code>.
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1 id=ranges>Ranges</h1>
    
    <p>A <code>Range</code> represents an immutable sequence between two given
    values.  It is either <i>inclusive</i> or <i>exclusive</i>: the former
    includes the endpoint; the latter does not. For example, 0–9 is a range
    consisting of all single-digit integers, expressed by specifying the
    start-point and endpoint.</p>

    <p>A <code>Range</code> literal consists of two values separated by two or
    three periods<a href=#fn-flip-flop>†</a>: the former range is inclusive;
    the latter exclusive. For example, <code>'a'...'z'</code> represents
    letters <i>a</i>–<i>y</i>.</p>
    
    <figure class=railroad>
      <img id=range-literal.png>
      <figcaption>Syntax diagram of the range literal
    </figure>
     
    <p>The start-point and endpoint must be comparable <!-- link --> with
    <code>#&lt;=&gt;</code>. That is, for a range
    <code><var>start</var>..<var>end</var></code>, <code><var>start</var>
      &lt;=&gt; <var>end</var></code> must return -1, 0, or 1.
    <code>Range#include?(<var>object</var>)</code> allows ranges
    to be used as intervals: returning <code>true</code> if <var>object</var>
    is a member; <code>false</code> otherwise.  
    
    <p>A range is <dfn title="discrete ranges">discrete</dfn> if it begins
    with a value that responds to <code>#succ</code> by returning the next
    element of the sequence. It is so called because it represents a finite
    set of values that can be iterated over with <code>Range#each</code>.
    Alternatively, <code>Range#step(<var>n</var>) {|<var>el</var>| }</code>
    passes each <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> element to the block. 
     
    <p>A non-discrete range is <dfn title="continuous range">continuous</dfn>.
    It represents an infinite set of values, therefore a
    <code>TypeError</code> is raised when attempting to iterate over it.

  <section>
    <h1 id=enumerable><code>Enumerable</code></h1>

    <p>The aforementioned classes-<code>Array</code>, <code>Hash</code>, and
    <code>Range</code>-mix-in the core module <code>Enumerable</code>. The
    methods it supplies are implemented in terms of a method named
    <code>#each</code> which yields each element of a collection in turn.
    <code>Enumerable</code> does not define <code>#each</code>, so a contract
    exists: if a class provides <code>#each</code> it can mix-in
    <code>Enumerable</code>. If a class breaches this contract, it will still
    gain the <code>Enumerable</code> methods, but invoking them will raise an
    exception. <code>Enumerable</code> provides nearly 50 methods, so a mere sample
    follows. 
    
    <p><code>#map {|<var>element</var>| }</code> returns an
    <code>Array</code> created by passing each element of the collection to
    the block, then storing the result. For example, <code>[1,2,3].map{|n|
      n**2} #=&gt; [1,4,9]</code>. <!-- Symbol#to_proc ? -->
     
    <p><code>#reduce {|<var>element<sub>0</sub></var>,
      <var>element<sub>n</sub></var>| }</code> passes the first two
    elements to the block, then for each subsequent element the last
    result of the block and the element itself. For example:
    <code>[2,3,5,7].reduce(&amp;:+) =&gt; 17</code>.
     
    <p><code>#select {|<var>element</var>| }</code> returns an
    <code>Array</code> of elements for which the block returned
    <code>true</code>.
    
    <p>Lastly, <code>#any?</code>, <code>#all?</code>, and <code>#none?</code>
    accept a block which is called with an element of the collection. The
    determinative indicates how many elements of the collection the block must
    return <code>true</code> for the method to return <code>true</code>. For
    instance, <code>#any?</code> returns <code>true</code> as soon as a single
    element in the collection satisfies the block.</p>

      <h1 id=no-each>Classes with Multiple Iteration Strategies</h1>

      <p>For <code>Enumerable</code> to be a sensible addition to a class, the
      collection must support a single, obvious means of iteration. If multiple
      approaches are plausible, the semantics of the <code>Enumerable</code>
      methods will be confusing. 
      
      <p>For example, consider the <code>String</code> class. A
      <code>String</code> of binary data will probably be iterated by byte, a
      <code>String</code> containing a document may be iterated by line or
      paragraph, a hyphenation algorithm would iterate by character or Unicode
      codepoint. There is no single <code>#each</code> method that encompasses
      these approaches. There is no objective atomic unit that can form the
      basis of iteration. Accordingly, <code>String#each</code> does not
      exist. In its place are alternative iterators:
      <code>String#each_byte</code>, <code>String#each_char</code>,
      <code>String#each_codepoint</code>, and <code>String#each_line</code>.

      <p>The utility of this approach is seen when combining it with
      <code>Object#enum_for(<var>selector</var>)</code>. This method converts
      its receiver into an <code>Enumerator</code> object, which is an
      iterator implemented in terms of the receiver’s <var>selector</var>
      method. An <code>Enumerator</code> has an <code>#each</code> method and
      mixes-in <code>Enumerable</code>. Hence, one can convert an object into
      <code>Enumerable</code> by specifying which form of iteration should be
      used by <code>#each</code>.</p>

        <figcaption>Using an object that does not respond to
        <code>:each</code> as an <code>Enumerable</code> by specifying which
