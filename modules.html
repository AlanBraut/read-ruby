  <h1 id=modules>Modules</h1>

  <p>A <dfn>module</dfn> is <q cite=/references#refFLAN08>a named group of
    methods, constants, and class variables</q> (<a class=ref
    href=/references#refFLAN08>Flanagan &amp; Matsumoto</a>). It is,
  therefore, similar to a class except it can neither inherit behaviour nor be
  instantiated. Indeed, <code>Module</code> is the superclass of
  <code>Class</code>, the latter defining only three additional methods:
  <code>:new</code>, <code>:allocate</code>, and <code>:superclass</code>.</p>

      <p>The <code>module <var>name</var>…end</code> expression opens a module
      named <var>name</var>. If the constant <var>name</var> is already
      defined it must refer to an existing module, otherwise a
      <code>TypeError</code> is raised.  If <var>name</var> was previously
      undefined, it is created as a <code>Module</code> object. That both
      modules and classes are named with constants, means they share the same
      namespace: a given (qualified) constant cannot name a class and a module
      simultaneously. The module body, which may be empty, is the elliptical
      region in the expression. It introduces a new context in which
      <code>self</code> refers to the current module.</p>

      <section>
        <h1 id=reopening>Reopening Modules</h1>

        <p>If <code>module</code> is used with the name of a pre-existing
        module that module is <i>re-opened</i>. If a method is defined in a
        re-opened module with the same name as a pre-existing method in the
        same module the old method is overwritten with the new.</p>

        <p>Modules can be made immutable, effectively preventing them from
        being reopened by freezing the module object. Frozen modules raise
        <code>RuntimeError</code>s when methods are defined, or variables
        manipulated, in their context.

      <h1 id=module-new><code>Module.new</code></h1>

      <p>The <code>Module.new</code> constructor can be used to create a new
      anonymous module. It is usually passed a block argument which is
      evaluated in the context of the created module using
      <code>module_eval</code>.</p>

      <!-- Bug related to the below's semantics:
      http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/1982 -->
      <p><code>Kernel.load</code> can<a href=#fn-load-true>†</a> use an
      anonymous module to prevent a source file from affecting the global
      namespace. The classes and modules the source file defines are created
      in the context of this anonymous namespace, making them inaccessible to
      the caller. The source file must explicitly specify the constants it
      wishes to share with the caller by assigning them to global variables.

      <p>A module is an object like any other, so by assigning an anonymous
      object to a <a href=/variables#local>local variable</a>, for example, it
      only exists for as long as the variable does, and is invisible from
      disjoint scopes.</p>

      <p>However, magic happens if you assign an anonymous module to a
      constant: the module takes on its name. Specifically, sending
      <code>:to_s</code><a href=#fn-module-to-s>†</a> to an anonymous module
      causes a search to be done for the first constant the module was
      assigned to: if one is found, that becomes the module’s name.</p>

      <p>This technique cannot be used to re‐open modules. Assigning an
      anonymous module to a constant naming another module creates a new
      module with the same name, clobbering the old one.</p>

    <h1 id=mixins>Mixins</h1>

    <!-- Should we describe these methods as 'instance' methods? -->
    <p>The primary use of modules is <dfn>mixins</dfn>: imbuing a given
    class with the instance methods, or <dfn>features</dfn>, of a given
    module. A class may have any number of modules mixed in.</p>

    <section>
      <h1 id=mixin-to-class>Mixing a Module into a Class</h1>
      
      <!-- TODO: Define 'multiple inheritance'? -->
      <p>Mixing-in a module to a class effectively enables multiple
      inheritance: appending to the class features from any number of
      sources. By contrast, classes may only <a
        href=/classes#inheritance>inherit</a> from a maximum of one other
      class.
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1 id=mixin-to-module>Mixing a Module into a Module</h1>
      
      <p>It is less common to mixin a module to another module, but legal
      nevertheless. The result is simply that the features of the included
      module are copied to the other module.
      </section>
    
    <section>
      <h1 id=inclusion>Inclusion</h1>

      <p><code>Module#include</code> takes one or more module names as
      arguments, then mixes them in to the enclosing class. Contrary to
      intuition, the named modules are mixed-in in the reverse order in
      which they are named. That is, <code>include A, B</code> appends the
      features of module <code>B</code>, then module <code>A</code>.
      Therefore, if <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> define an instance
      method with the same name, <code>B</code>’s copy will be overwritten
      by <code>A</code>’s.</p>

      <p>Specifically, when used in the context of a class named
      <var>class</var> <code>#include</code> sends each of its arguments
      <code>:append_features</code> with <var>class</var> as an argument. The
      default behaviour is defined by <code>Module#append_features</code>,
      which adds the named modules to <var>class</var>’s method search path
      then sends the <a href=#included><code>:included</code></a> message to
      each. A corollary is that if a class defines its own
      <code>#append_features</code> method, it must call <code>super</code> so
      as to invoke <code>Module#append_features</code>; otherwise, the module
      is not mixed in.</p>

      <section>
        <h1 id=included><code>included</code> Callback</h1>
        
        <p>When a module has been included in a class it is sent a message
        named <code>:included</code>, with the class name as an argument. This
        allows the module to perform initialization such as dynamically adding
        additional methods or variables to the named class. Be aware, however,
        that <code>:included</code> is sent <em>every</em> time
        <code>Module#include</code> is used, even if the module is already
        included in the class.

        <p><code>:included</code> is sent <em>after</em> the module has been
        included, so is powerless to prevent the inclusion or otherwise
        condition it on some prerequisite. Its return value is ignored because
        <code>Module#include</code> always returns the class object in which
        it is used. 
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1 id=class-include><code>Class#include?</code></h1>
        
        <p>The <code>Class#include?</code> predicate returns
        <code>true</code> if the module given as its argument has been
        mixed-in to the receiver; <code>false</code> otherwise.
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h1 id=class-included-modules><code>Class#included_modules</code></h1>

        <p><code>Class#included_modules</code> returns an <code>Array</code>
        of <code>Module</code>s mixed-in to the receiver in the reverse
        order of their inclusion. As <code>Object</code> includes the
        <code>Kernel</code> module, this method will usually return
        <code>Kernel</code> as the last element.

      <h1 id=extension>Extension</h1>
      
      <p>Given a list of modules, <code>Kernel#extend</code> mixes them into
      to a specific object by <a href=#inclusion>including</a> them in its
      receiver’s <a href=/classes#singleton>singleton class</a>. Specifically,
      it sends each of its arguments an <code>:extend_object</code> message
      with the receiver as an argument. The default behaviour of
      <code>:extend_object</code> is provided by <code>Module</code>, which <a
        href=#inclusion>includes</a> the module into the receiver’s singleton
      class, then sends the module an <a
        href=#extended><code>:extended</code></a> message. As with
      <code>Module#append_features</code>, modules which define their own
      <code>#extend_object</code> methods must employ <code>super</code> to
      actually effect the extension.</p>

        <h1 id=extend-self>Extending <code>self</code></h1>

        <p>An idiomatic application of <code>extend</code> is to use
        <code>extend self</code> within the context of a module. The effect
        is to mix the current module into its <a
          href=/classes#singleton>singleton class</a>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href=/methods#public-methods>Public</a> instance methods
          can be invoked as instance methods in the context of the module,
          i.e. without an explicit receiver, and singleton methods of the
          module from anywhere.
          <li><a href=/methods#private-methods>Private</a> and <a
            href=/methods#protected-methods>protected</a> instance methods
          can only be invoked from within the context of the module. 
        </ul>

  <section>
    <h1 id=namespacing>Namespacing</h1>

    <p>Modules can be used for <dfn>namespacing</dfn>: to combine a set of
    methods with a common purpose so their names do not clash with unrelated
    methods, and they are able to share data. Classes can be <a
      href=/classes#nesting>used in the same way</a>.

    <p>Modules are preferable to classes in this respect when the namespace
    cannot be sensibly instantiated. The use of a module clarifies this aspect
    of the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>.</p>

    <p>Methods are defined in the module’s <a
      href=/classes#singleton>singleton class</a>, then invoked with the
    module name as the receiver:
    <code><var>module</var>.<var>selector</var></code>.</p>

    <figure class=left id=module-namespacing.rb>
      <figcaption>Modules can be used as namespaces by defining methods on
      their singleton class
    </figure>

    <p><a href=/references#refBROWN09 class=ref>Brown</a> (pp. 133–138)
    suggests this technique can be useful in the following circumstances:</p>

    <blockquote cite=/references#refBROWN09>
      <ul>
        <li>You are solving a single, atomic task that involves lots of steps
        that would be better broken out into helper functions.
        <li>You are wrapping some functions that don’t rely on much common
        state between them, but are related to a common topic.
        <li>The code is very general and can be used standalone or the code is
        very specific but doesn’t relate directly to the object that it is
        meant to be used by.
        <li>The problem you are solving is small enough where object
        orientation does more to get in the way than it does to help you.
      </ul>
      <cite><a href=/references#refBROWN09 class=ref>Ruby Best
          Practices</a></cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This technique can be used in conjunction with <a
      href=#extend-self><code>extend self</code></a> to create private
    helper methods: accessible to the module methods; inaccessible from
    outside the module.</p>

  <section>
    <h1 id=module-functions>Module Functions</h1>

    <p>A single module may be used both as a namespace and a mix-in. The
    first case requires the module’s methods to be singleton methods on the
    <code>Module</code> object; the second requires them to be instance
    methods.</p>
    
    <figure class=left id=module-namespace-and-mixin.rb>      
      <figcaption>The <code>Math</code> module can be used as both a
      namespace and a mix-in.
    </figure>

    <p>One solution is <code>Module#module_function</code>, which is used to
    convert a mix-in module to a namespace module. In the context of a
    module, <code>module_function</code> is provided with one or more
    instance method names as arguments. Alternatively,
    <code>module_function</code> may be invoked without arguments, in which
    case it affects all instance methods defined subsequently within the
    same module. In both cases, each affected method is copied to the
    module’s singleton class then the original method is made private. The
    duplication satisfies the requirement that methods are both instance and
    singleton methods. The visibility change forces classes which mix-in the
    module to invoke its methods in the “functional style”, that is without
    an explicit receiver, so as not to confuse them with traditional
    instance methods (<a href=/references#refFLAN08 class=ref>Flanagan &amp;
      Matsumoto</a>, pp. 251–252).</p>

    <figure class=left id=module-function.rb>
      <figcaption><code>module_function</code> enables a module to be used
      both as a namespace and mix-in
    </figure>

    <p>A weakness of <code>module_function</code> is that it prevents a
    singleton method of the module from calling a private method of the same
    module.</p>

    <p><a href=#extend-self><code>extend self</code></a> does not
