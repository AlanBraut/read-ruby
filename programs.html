  <p>Every entity in Ruby is an object. Objects can remember things and
  communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages (<a
    href=/references#refGOLDBERG76>Goldberg &amp; Kay</a>, p 44). A Ruby
  program describes how certain objects must communicate to achieve some
  definite ends. This chapter provides an overview of the structure and
  interpretation of Ruby programs.</p>

    <!-- Aho, 2nd ed., p43: tokens vs. terminals -->
    <!-- TODO: Introduce tokenization --> <p><dfn>Tokens</dfn><a
      href=#fn-ripper>†</a> are <q>the mark or series of marks that denote one
      symbol or word in the language</q> (<a
      href=/references#refFISCHER92>Fischer &amp; Grodzinsky</a>, pp.  59–62).
    A Ruby program consists of a combination of the following tokens: <a
      href=#comments>comments</a>, <a href=/objects#literals>literals</a>, <a
      href=/punctuation>punctuation</a>, <a href=#identifiers>identifiers</a>,
    and <a href=/keywords>keywords</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h1 id=comments>Comments</h1>

      <p><dfn>Comments</dfn> are remarks which do not affect the meaning of a
      program. They are introduced with a number sign (<code class=u
        title='#'>U＋0023</code>) and continue until the end of the line: the
      text between <code>#</code> and the end of the line is ignored by the
      interpreter. Comments are not recognised inside of <a
        href=/objects#strings>string</a>/<a href=/objects#regexps>regexp</a>
      literals—they are interpreted literally—however, regexps support an
      alternative form of embedded comment. There is no specific construct for
      multiline comments, but they may be approximated with <a
        href=#embedded-doc>embedded documentation</a>.

    <section>
      <h1 id=embedded-doc>Embedded Documentation</h1>

      <p><dfn>Embedded documentation</dfn> is a portion of a source file that
      contains documentation intended for a postprocessor such as
      <code>rdoc</code>, and as such is ignored by the interpreter. It is
      introduced by a line beginning <code>=begin</code>, that is an equals
      sign (<code class=u title='='>U＋003D</code>) followed by the string
      <code>begin</code>, and continues until a line beginning
      <code>=end</code> is encountered.

      <p>Both <code>=begin</code> and <code>=end</code> may be followed by
      arbitrary text, which is included in the embedded documentation, as long
      as it is preceded by a whitespace character. Conventionally, the text
      following <code>=begin </code> names the tool for which the
      documentation is intended.

    <section>
      <h1 id=whitespace>Whitespace</h1>

      <p><dfn>Whitespace</dfn> consists only of <code class=u>U＋0009</code>,
      <code class=u>U＋000B</code>–<code class=u>U＋000D</code>, and the space
      character (<code class=u title=' '>U＋0020</code>), i.e. <abbr
        title='American Standard Code for Information
        Interchange'>ASCII</abbr> whitespace other than the newline. Its
      primary role in Ruby syntax is to separate tokens and terminate
      statements. When whitespace is syntactically significant it is typically
      collapsed to a single space.  The few areas of syntax where whitespace
      has different semantics are clearly labeled. 
      
      <p>Newlines may function as whitespace, too, depending on the context in
      which they are used. See the section entitled <a
        href=#statement-terminators>Statement Terminators &amp; Newlines</a>
      for further details.

      <p>An <dfn>expression</dfn><a href=#fn-expression-rec>†</a> is a

      <p>A statement is an expression whose value is ignored<a

        <p>One statement must be separated from the next by a statement

          title=';'>U＋003B</code>) or <a href=#newlines>newline</a>. The latter
        is preferred because it leads to a natural separation: each statement on
        its own line. However, a newline does not terminate a statement if:
        
        <ul>
          <li>It is immediately preceded by a reverse solidus (<code

    <h1 id=interpretation>Interpretation</h1>

    <p>The statements and expressions that comprise a program are collectively
    known as its <dfn>source code</dfn>. To execute a program its source code
    must be provided to a Ruby <dfn>interpreter</dfn>: the program that
    executes Ruby source code. The reference implementation<a
      href=#fn-mri-19>†</a> of Ruby, or <abbr title="Matz’s Ruby
      Implementation">MRI</abbr>, contains an interpreter called
    <code>ruby</code>, so when we speak of executing the interpreter we are
    referring to running this program. The sections that follow explain the
    various ways to execute source code.</p>

    <section>
      <h1 id=source-files>Source Files</h1>

      <p>Ruby programs are typically stored in plain text files with an
      <code>.rb</code> filename extension. They are then executed by supplying
      their filenames as arguments to the <code>ruby</code> binary, e.g.
      <code>ruby myfile.rb</code> would execute the source code saved in
      <code>myfile.rb</code>.</p>

      <section>
        <h1 id=shebang>Shebang</h1>

        <p>The <dfn>shebang</dfn><a href=#fn-shebang>†</a> is a notation for
        informing a UNIX-like operating system of the interpreter with which a
        script should be executed. If present it must appear as the first line
        of a source file. It begins with a number sign (<code class=u
          title='#'>U＋0023</code>) making it a legal comment line, therefore
        ignored by the interpreter, which is followed by an exclamation mark
        (<code class=u title='!'>U＋0021</code>) then the path to the
        interpreter.</p>

        <p>A typical shebang is <code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby -w</code> which uses
        <code>env</code> to avoid hardcoding the path to the interpreter, and
        passes the <code>-w</code> option to the interpreter to enable warnings.

        <p>If a script containing a shebang is executable it may be executed by
        entering its filename in the shell. This allows the interpreter to be
        invoked implicitly, and is a common approach.
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1 id=source-encoding>Source Encoding</h1>

        <p>The <dfn>source encoding</dfn> is the character encoding of a given
        source file. It is US-ASCII by default. A <code>SyntaxError</code> is
        raised when a source file contains one or more characters invalid in the
        source encoding.

        <p>A file’s source encoding may be specified inline by means of a
        <dfn>coding comment</dfn>: a specially formatted comment that declares
        the encoding of the lines that follow. If omitted, the default source
        encoding is assumed. If a source file contains a <a
          href=#shebang>shebang</a> line, the coding comment must appear on the
        second line; otherwise it must appear on the first.</p>

        <p>The coding comment is a US-ASCII string which begins with a number
        sign (<code class=u title='#'>U＋0023</code>) and contains<a
          href=#fn-coding-contain>†</a> the string <code>coding</code>
        followed by an equals sign (<code class=u title='='>U＋003D</code>) or
        colon (<code class=u title=':'>U＋003A</code>) then the name of the
        source encoding. The encoding name is one of those returned by
        <code>Encoding.name_list</code> written in a case insensitive fashion.

        <p>The source encoding of the currently executing code can be obtained
        with the <a href=#encoding><code>__ENCODING__</code></a>
        keyword.
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1 id=warnings>Warnings</h1>

        <p><dfn>Warnings</dfn>— notices of deprecated, ambiguous, or otherwise
        problematic, code— are enabled when the interpreter is given the
        <code>-w</code> switch, e.g. <code>ruby -w myfile.rb</code>. For
        example, Ruby warns when a <a href=/variables#constants>constant</a>
        that has already been defined is assigned to.

      <h1 id=irb>IRB</h1> 

      <p>Ruby is distributed with a program called <code>irb</code> which
      provides an interactive shell, or read‐eval‐print loop, for the
      interpreter. <abbr title="Interactive Ruby">IRB</abbr> works as follows:
      
      <ol>
        <li>You enter a statement of Ruby and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
        <li>That statement is evaluated and its value printed to the screen.
        <li>You go back to step 1.
      </ol>
  
      <p>This provides a superb environment for learning Ruby. As you read
      this book you can enter the examples in IRB and see for yourself how
      they work.
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1 id=eval>Evaluating Strings</h1>

      <p>Source code can be provided as an command-line argument to the
      interpreter if it is invoked with the <code>-e</code> switch, e.g.
      <code>ruby -e 'puts 1 + 2'</code> executes the code fragment and
      displays <samp>3</samp>.

      <p>The <code>Kernel.eval</code> method provides similar functionality
      from within a program. Pass it an arbitrary string of source code as an
      argument and it will return the result. Continuing with the above
      example: <code>eval 'puts 1 + 2'</code>.
