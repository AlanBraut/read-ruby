  <title>Enumerables</title>
  
  <para>Enumerables are objects that represent collections of other
  objects. They are so named because they mix-in the
  <literal>Enumerable</literal> module, which enhances such objects with
  powerful methods for manipulating collections. Indeed, the core classes <link
  linkend="arr.arrays"><literal>Array</literal></link>, <link
  linkend="has.hashes"><literal>Hash</literal></link>, and <link
  linkend="enu.ranges"><literal>Range</literal></link>.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="enu.ranges">
    <title>Ranges</title>
    
    <para>
      A <literal>Range</literal> represents an immutable sequence between two
      given values.  It is either <emphasis>inclusive</emphasis> or
      <emphasis>exclusive</emphasis>: the former includes the endpoint; the
      latter does not. For example, 0–9 is a range consisting of all
      single-digit integers, expressed by specifying the start-point and
      endpoint.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      A <literal>Range</literal> literal consists of two values separated by
      two or three full stops<footnote>
        <para
          >In the
          conditional of a branching or looping statement, two or three
          consecutive full stops don’t create a range; they constitute a <link
            linkend="flo.flip-flop">Boolean flip-flop</link>.
        </para>
      </footnote>: the former range is inclusive; the latter exclusive.  For
      example, <literal>'a'...'z'</literal> represents letters
      <emphasis>a</emphasis>–<emphasis>y</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The start-point and endpoint must be comparable  with
      <literal>#&lt;=&gt;</literal>. That is, for a range
      <literal><replaceable>start</replaceable>..<replaceable>end</replaceable></literal>,
      <literal><replaceable>start</replaceable> &lt;=&gt;
        <replaceable>end</replaceable></literal> must return -1, 0, or 1.
      <literal>Range#include?(<replaceable>object</replaceable>)</literal>
      allows ranges to be used as intervals: returning <literal>true</literal>
      if <replaceable>object</replaceable> is a member;
      <literal>false</literal> otherwise.
    </para>

    <para>
      A range is <firstterm>discrete</firstterm> if it begins with a value
      that responds to <literal>#succ</literal> by returning the next element
      of the sequence. It is so called because it represents a finite set of
      values that can be iterated over with <literal>Range#each</literal>.
      Alternatively, <literal>Range#step(<replaceable>n</replaceable>)
        {|<replaceable>el</replaceable>| }</literal> passes each
      <replaceable>n</replaceable><superscript>th</superscript> element to the
      block.</para> <para>A non-discrete range is
      <firstterm>continuous</firstterm>.  It represents an infinite set of
      values, therefore a <literal>TypeError</literal> is raised when
      attempting to iterate over it.

    <title><literal>Enumerable</literal></title>

    <para>
      The aforementioned classes-<literal>Array</literal>,
      <literal>Hash</literal>, and <literal>Range</literal>-mix-in the core
      module <literal>Enumerable</literal>. The methods it supplies are
      implemented in terms of a method named <literal>#each</literal> which
      yields each element of a collection in turn.
      <literal>Enumerable</literal> does not define <literal>#each</literal>,
      so a contract exists: if a class provides <literal>#each</literal> it
      can mix-in <literal>Enumerable</literal>. If a class breaches this
      contract, it will still gain the <literal>Enumerable</literal> methods,
      but invoking them will raise an exception. <literal>Enumerable</literal>
      provides nearly 50 methods, so a mere sample follows.
    </para>

    <para>
      <literal>#map {|<replaceable>element</replaceable>| }</literal> returns
      an <literal>Array</literal> created by passing each element of the
      collection to the block, then storing the result. For example,
      <literal>[1,2,3].map{|n| n**2} #=&gt; [1,4,9]</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
      <literal>#reduce
        {|<replaceable>element<subscript>0</subscript></replaceable>,
        <replaceable>element<subscript>n</subscript></replaceable>|
        }</literal> passes the first two elements to the block, then for each
      subsequent element the last result of the block and the element itself.
      For example: <literal>[2,3,5,7].reduce(&amp;:+) =&gt; 17</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
      <literal>#select {|<replaceable>element</replaceable>| }</literal>
      returns an <literal>Array</literal> of elements for which the block
      returned <literal>true</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Lastly, <literal>#any?</literal>, <literal>#all?</literal>, and
      <literal>#none?</literal> accept a block which is called with an element
      of the collection. The determinative indicates how many elements of the
      collection the block must return <literal>true</literal> for the method
      to return <literal>true</literal>. For instance,
      <literal>#any?</literal> returns <literal>true</literal> as soon as a
      single element in the collection satisfies the block.
    </para>

    <sect2 xml:id="enu.no-each">
      <title>Classes with Multiple Iteration Strategies</title>
      
      <para>
        For <literal>Enumerable</literal> to be a sensible addition to a
        class, the collection must support a single, obvious means of
        iteration. If multiple approaches are plausible, the semantics of the
        <literal>Enumerable</literal> methods will be confusing.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, consider the <literal>String</literal> class. A
        <literal>String</literal> of binary data will probably be iterated by
        byte, a <literal>String</literal> containing a document may be
        iterated by line or paragraph, a hyphenation algorithm would iterate
        by character or Unicode codepoint. There is no single
        <literal>#each</literal> method that encompasses these approaches.
        There is no objective atomic unit that can form the basis of
        iteration. Accordingly, <literal>String#each</literal> does not exist.
        In its place are alternative iterators:
        <literal>String#each_byte</literal>,
        <literal>String#each_char</literal>,
        <literal>String#each_codepoint</literal>, and
        <literal>String#each_line</literal>.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The utility of this approach is seen when combining it with
        <literal>Object#enum_for(<replaceable>selector</replaceable>)</literal>.
        This method converts its receiver into an
        <literal>Enumerator</literal> object, which is an iterator implemented
        in terms of the receiver’s <replaceable>selector</replaceable> method.
        An <literal>Enumerator</literal> has an <literal>#each</literal>
        method and mixes-in <literal>Enumerable</literal>. Hence, one can
        convert an object into <literal>Enumerable</literal> by specifying
        which form of iteration should be used by <literal>#each</literal>.
      </para>
